1089_134686_000002_000001	after early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up , here and there , the squalid quarter of the brothels .
1089_134686_000007_000005	the stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space .
1089_134686_000009_000003	the chaos in which his ardour extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself .
1089_134686_000009_000008	what did it avail to pray when he knew that his soul lusted after its own destruction ?
1089_134686_000015_000003	the bell rang . the master marked the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson and went out .
1089_134686_000024_000002	if a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized ?
1089_134686_000026_000003	a gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged stephen to ask a difficult question .
1089_134686_000028_000004	mass will be on saturday morning at nine oclock and general communion for the whole college .
1089_134686_000030_000000	a little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the rectors grim smile .
1089_134686_000030_000001	stephens heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower .
1089_134686_000032_000006	he is said to have baptized as many as ten thousand idolaters in one month .
1089_134691_000004_000000	yes , his mother was hostile to the idea , as he had read from her listless silence .
1089_134691_000006_000000	whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms .
1089_134691_000007_000000	the pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused .
1089_134691_000013_000004	no , it was not their colours : it was the poise and balance of the period itself .
1089_134691_000015_000000	a veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river was embayed .
1089_134691_000025_000002	perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls .
1089_134691_000027_000000	their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his mild proud sovereignty .
1089_134691_000039_000000	he started up nervously from the stone block for he could no longer quench the flame in his blood .
1089_134691_000042_000001	emerald and black and russet and olive , it moved beneath the current , swaying and turning .
1089_134691_000042_000002	the water of the rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the high drifting clouds .
1089_134691_000045_000004	her slate blue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her .
1089_134691_000047_000000	heavenly god ! cried stephens soul , in an outburst of profane joy .
1089_134691_000049_000002	to live , to err , to fall , to triumph , to recreate life out of life !
1089_134691_000054_000000	evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid grasses of his bed glowed no longer .
1188_133604_000024_000000	but in this vignette , copied from turner , you have the two principles brought out perfectly .
1188_133604_000028_000003	george of carpaccio at venice , are all that i can name myself of great works .
1188_133604_000048_000001	every plant in the grass is set formally , grows perfectly , and may be realized completely .
1188_133604_000061_000006	it has no beauty whatsoever , no specialty of picturesqueness ; and all its lines are cramped and poor .
121_121726_000005_000001	the beggars plea , the politicians sceptre and the drummers ablest assistant .
121_121726_000025_000001	once held by hobson and dewey , now carried by mother eddy and brother dowie .
121_127105_000007_000003	this i took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait .
121_127105_000012_000000	he seemed to say it was not so simple as that ; to be really at a loss how to qualify it .
121_127105_000014_000000	he took no notice of her ; he looked at me , but as if , instead of me , he saw what he spoke of .
121_127105_000016_000000	he turned round to the fire , gave a kick to a log , watched it an instant .
121_127105_000018_000001	i took that here he tapped his heart . ive never lost it .
121_127105_000020_000004	but if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation .
121_127105_000020_000009	oh yes ; dont grin : i liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me , too .
121_127105_000033_000000	the story wont tell , said douglas ; not in any literal , vulgar way .
121_127105_000044_000003	the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time .
1284_1180_000007_000000	at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gillikins , the path divided .
1284_1180_000020_000000	i never knew i was called the unlucky , said ojo , soberly ; but it is really a good name for me .
1284_1180_000023_000000	i do not know how , but you must keep the matter in mind and perhaps the chance will come to you , she replied .
1284_1180_000027_000000	we are traveling , replied ojo , and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves .
1284_1180_000045_000002	what is that ? ojo asked , for this seemed even more strange and unusual than a glass cat .
1284_1180_000053_000001	i will show you what a good job i did , and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors .
1284_1181_000027_000000	this powder must not be used before to morrow morning ; but i think it is now cool enough to be bottled .
1284_1181_000028_000001	very carefully he placed the powder of life in the gold bottle and then locked it up in a drawer of his cabinet .
1320_122612_000002_000000	if you find a man there , he shall die a fleas death . merry wives of windsor .
1320_122612_000006_000004	at last the scout spoke in english , and at once explained the embarrassment of their situation .
1320_122612_000020_000001	a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn , and each of the party took a segment for his portion .
1320_122612_000021_000000	such cunning is not without its deviltry , exclaimed hawkeye , when he met the disappointed looks of his assistants .
1320_122612_000029_000000	the whole party now proceeded , following the course of the rill , keeping anxious eyes on the regular impressions .
1320_122612_000033_000000	softly , softly , we know our path ; but it is good to examine the formation of things .
1320_122612_000037_000001	see , the heel has hardly touched the ground ; and there the dark hair has made a little jump , from root to root .
1320_122612_000037_000002	no , no ; my knowledge for it , neither of them was nigh fainting , hereaway .
1320_122612_000051_000001	do you keep him under your rifle while i creep in behind , through the bush , and take him alive .
1320_122612_000056_000003	having reached within a few yards of the latter , he arose to his feet , silently and slowly .
1320_122617_000043_000001	so , uncas , you had better take the lead , while i will put on the skin again , and trust to cunning for want of speed .
1580_141083_000006_000000	my friends temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street .
1580_141083_000006_000001	without his scrapbooks , his chemicals , and his homely untidiness , he was an uncomfortable man .
1580_141083_000008_000004	i had , however , promised to take tea in a friends rooms , so i left the proof upon my desk .
1580_141083_000009_000002	for an instant i imagined that i had left my own there , but on feeling in my pocket i found that it was all right .
1580_141083_000012_000000	the first page on the floor , the second in the window , the third where you left it , said he .
1580_141083_000015_000000	for an instant i imagined that bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers .
1580_141083_000015_000002	the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door , had known that i was out , and had entered to look at the papers .
1580_141083_000016_000006	evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry , had broken his pencil , and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it .
1580_141083_000017_000000	excellent ! said holmes , who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case .
1580_141083_000018_000004	not only this , but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay , with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it .
1580_141083_000047_000007	he carried them over to the window table , because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard , and so could effect an escape .
1580_141083_000056_000006	i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin , some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface .
1580_141083_000061_000001	as a matter of fact , the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs .
1580_141083_000063_000000	it was a small pyramid of black , putty like stuff , exactly like the one upon the table of the study .
1580_141083_000066_000002	what could he do ? he caught up everything which would betray him , and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself .
1580_141083_000070_000000	lattice paned , lead framework , three separate windows , one swinging on hinge , and large enough to admit a man .
1580_141083_000081_000003	his father was the notorious sir jabez gilchrist , who ruined himself on the turf .
1580_141084_000009_000001	a tall , flaxen haired , slim young fellow opened it , and made us welcome when he understood our errand .
1580_141084_000009_000007	the outer door would not open to our knock , and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it .
1580_141084_000029_000001	all were agreed that one could be ordered , but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock .
1580_141084_000029_000002	my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure , but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation .
1580_141084_000031_000000	holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day , though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner .
1580_141084_000044_000000	the unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers .
1580_141084_000069_000001	he was a fine figure of a man , tall , lithe , and agile , with a springy step and a pleasant , open face .
1580_141084_000071_000000	the unfortunate young man staggered back , and cast a look full of horror and reproach at bannister .
1580_141084_000075_000000	come , come , said holmes , kindly , it is human to err , and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal .
1580_141084_000077_000003	i was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see , as he passed , what papers were on the central table .
1580_141084_000077_000004	i am six feet high , and i could do it with an effort . no one less than that would have a chance .
1580_141084_000078_000001	of the centre table i could make nothing , until in your description of gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long distance jumper .
1580_141084_000079_000002	as he passed your window he saw , by means of his great height , these proofs upon your table , and conjectured what they were .
1580_141084_000079_000005	it was not a dangerous exploit for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question .
1580_141084_000082_000007	you observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side , but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door .
1995_1826_000016_000011	she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms .
1995_1826_000022_000001	miss taylor did not know much about cotton , but at least one more remark seemed called for .
1995_1826_000056_000000	she started thinking of cotton but at once she pulled herself back to the other aspect .
1995_1836_000003_000002	at last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the senate .
1995_1836_000019_000000	but , cresswell added significantly , capacity differs enormously between races .
1995_1837_000010_000005	to her all things meant something nothing was aimless , nothing merely happened .
1995_1837_000011_000002	perhaps if the water had but drained from the cotton ! it was so strong and tall ! but , p shaw !
1995_1837_000012_000003	the rain drops were still dripping and gleaming from the trees , flashing back the heavy yellow sunlight .
1995_1837_000019_000001	the cotton crop was short and poor because of the great rain ; but the sun had saved the best , and the price had soared .
1995_1837_000021_000002	the sun , the swamp ? then finding all well , she closed her eyes and slept .
1995_1837_000026_000002	he came down to her slowly , with fixed , hungry eyes , threading his way amid the fleece .
2300_131720_000003_000001	it went into service august fifteenth eighteen eighty two , about three weeks before the pearl street station .
2300_131720_000004_000006	why , if we erect a station at the falls , it is a great economy to get it up to the city .
2300_131720_000004_000012	burbank and his tribe represent in the vegetable world , edison in the mechanical .
2300_131720_000006_000001	every department of mechanics was stimulated and benefited to an extraordinary degree .
2300_131720_000008_000007	i requested him to make a sheet brass oil cup and solder it to the base i had .
2300_131720_000008_000009	i then had a standard made to hold another oil cup , so as to see and regulate the drop feed .
2300_131720_000016_000012	they found an engine somewhat loose in the bearings , and there followed remarks which would not look well in print .
2300_131720_000019_000001	at this time and long after , all arc lighting was done on a flat rate basis .
2300_131720_000020_000008	hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used , despite its excellent qualities .
2300_131720_000023_000003	the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine , and probably up to the close of the century .
2300_131720_000025_000007	the heat from this lamp would prevent the liquid from freezing , so that the meter could go on doing its duty .
2300_131720_000026_000000	after the station had been running several months and was technically a success , we began to look after the financial part .
2300_131720_000026_000007	they said they were sorry that is , wall street sorry and refused to pay it .
2300_131720_000032_000005	the investors in the enterprise were ready and anxious to meet the extra cost of putting the wires underground .
2300_131720_000034_000005	one evening there came a sudden flash of fire and a spluttering , sizzling noise .
2300_131720_000039_000007	we had two wire underground feeders , sent without any plans or specifications for their installation .
2300_131720_000040_000005	among the exhibits of that exposition was the edison system of incandescent lighting .
2300_131720_000042_000002	the machinery was taken up in pieces on the backs of mules from the foot of the mountain .
237_126133_000002_000004	it got to be noticed finally ; and one and all redoubled their exertions to make everything twice as pleasant as ever !
237_126133_000015_000001	somehow , of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest , this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer .
237_126133_000021_000000	at this , the bundle opened suddenly , and out popped phronsie !
237_126133_000024_000000	arent you glad ive come , polly ? asked phronsie , with her little face close to pollys own .
237_126133_000028_000000	is her name phronsie , put in dick , unwilling to be left out , and not thinking of anything else to ask .
237_126133_000029_000000	boys , whispered their mother , warningly , she cant answer you ; just look at her face .
237_126133_000034_000000	i know , gasped polly , controlling her sobs ; i wont only i cant thank you !
237_126133_000043_000000	so you must , cried jasper , enchanted at his success in amusing ; and ill go with you .
237_126133_000046_000000	oh phronsie ! cried polly , turning around at the last words ; how could you !
237_134493_000002_000002	could he rise from beneath it , he would not know the country under which he has been asleep .
237_134493_000002_000003	the shaggy coat of the prairie , which they lifted to make him a bed , has vanished forever .
237_134493_000004_000003	the air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled , as if the one were the breath of the other .
237_134493_000007_000000	when he had been mowing the better part of an hour , he heard the rattle of a light cart on the road behind him .
237_134493_000007_000001	supposing that it was his sister coming back from one of her farms , he kept on with his work .
237_134493_000011_000000	lots of the bohemian boys at the university are , said emil , taking up his scythe again .
237_134493_000013_000001	oh , theres no denying youre a spunky little bunch , you czechs , he called back over his shoulder .
237_134493_000017_000001	oh , theres a good boy ! she turned her head to him with a quick , bright smile .
237_134493_000021_000001	there were so many sheds and outbuildings grouped about it that the place looked not unlike a tiny village .
237_134493_000021_000002	a stranger , approaching it , could not help noticing the beauty and fruitfulness of the outlying fields .
237_134493_000021_000003	there was something individual about the great farm , a most unusual trimness and care for detail .
237_134493_000022_000001	one room is papered , carpeted , over furnished ; the next is almost bare .
237_134500_000001_000002	one of the goulds was getting a divorce , and frank took it as a personal affront .
237_134500_000001_000004	frank read english slowly , and the more he read about this divorce case , the angrier he grew .
237_134500_000003_000004	frank and lou bergson had very similar ideas , and they were two of the political agitators of the county .
237_134500_000014_000002	im a good catholic , but i think i could get along with caring for trees , if i hadnt anything else .
237_134500_000015_000000	thats a poor saying , said emil , stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass .
237_134500_000016_000002	i like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do .
237_134500_000022_000000	oh , emil , you know what i mean ! marie tossed her head impatiently . does she really care about him ?
237_134500_000023_000000	who , alexandra ? emil laughed and thrust his hands into his trousers pockets .
237_134500_000031_000000	and there are so many , many things i cant do . emil echoed her tone sarcastically .
237_134500_000032_000001	i wish you werent so restless , and didnt get so worked up over things , she said sadly .
237_134500_000036_000003	and , anyhow , theres nothing to understand ! she struck the ground with her little foot fiercely .
237_134500_000036_000005	it will go away , and things will be just as they used to . i wish you were a catholic .
260_123286_000005_000001	he examines the horizon all round with his glass , and folds his arms with the air of an injured man .
260_123286_000007_000000	you seem anxious , my uncle , i said , seeing him continually with his glass to his eye .
260_123286_000013_000000	i then remembered that the professor , before starting , had estimated the length of this underground sea at thirty leagues .
260_123286_000020_000000	i take this as my answer , and i leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience .
260_123286_000021_000005	i was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric light should grow dim , or fail altogether .
260_123286_000031_000003	they possessed a perfect organisation , gigantic proportions , prodigious strength .
260_123286_000033_000003	yet the deep marks of conical teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile .
260_123286_000034_000003	what a very bad notion that was of his , i thought to myself , to take soundings just here !
260_123286_000038_000001	the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again , at a distance of twenty fathoms .
260_123286_000045_000001	we stood amazed , thunderstruck , at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters .
260_123286_000047_000001	the reptiles rose ; they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains .
260_123286_000057_000001	two monsters only were creating all this commotion ; and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world .
260_123288_000004_000001	the atmosphere is charged with vapours , pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters .
260_123288_000006_000000	in the distance the clouds resemble great bales of cotton , piled up in picturesque disorder .
260_123288_000023_000005	my eyes fail under the dazzling light , my ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder .
260_123288_000023_000006	i must be bound to the mast , which bows like a reed before the mighty strength of the storm .
260_123288_000040_000000	a suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air , it enters the throat , it fills the lungs .
260_123288_000045_000004	we have been carried under england , under the channel , under france , perhaps under the whole of europe .
260_123440_000010_000002	and yesterday things went on just as usual . i wonder if ive been changed in the night ?
260_123440_000018_000002	that will be a queer thing , to be sure ! however , everything is queer to day .
260_123440_000023_000001	and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah : i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her .
260_123440_000024_000002	our family always hated cats : nasty , low , vulgar things !
2830_3979_000018_000000	the reformer had lectured on this epistle of saint pauls in fifteen nineteen and again in fifteen twenty three .
2830_3979_000018_000002	in his table talks the saying is recorded : the epistle to the galatians is my epistle .
2830_3979_000018_000006	the lectures which are preserved in the works herewith submitted to the american public were delivered in fifteen thirty one .
2830_3979_000023_000000	glory to god in the highest , and on earth peace , good will to men .
2830_3980_000017_000001	do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would disown his entire church ?
2830_3980_000018_000000	against these boasting , false apostles , paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry .
2830_3980_000018_000002	he reminds them of the time when he opposed peter to his face and reproved the chief of the apostles .
2830_3980_000021_000000	every minister should make much of his calling and impress upon others the fact that he has been delegated by god to preach the gospel .
2830_3980_000022_000002	paul exalts his ministry out of the desire to make known the name , the grace , and the mercy of god .
2961_961_000008_000000	socrates : excellent , timaeus , i like your manner of approaching the subject proceed .
2961_961_000011_000000	are there many worlds or one only ? that is the fourth question . one only .
2961_961_000020_000001	and god created them according to the patterns or species of them which existed in the divine original .
2961_961_000023_000007	and when external impressions enter in , they are really conquered , though they seem to conquer .
2961_961_000024_000002	this , however , is an after stage at present , we are only concerned with the creation of the body and soul .
3570_5694_000007_000005	infirmities induced by over indulgence are among some peoples freely recognised as manly attributes .
3570_5694_000007_000009	this invidious traditional distinction has not lost its force even among the more advanced peoples of today .
3570_5694_000010_000001	he is no longer simply the successful , aggressive male , the man of strength , resource , and intrepidity .
3570_5694_000011_000004	costly entertainments , such as the potlatch or the ball , are peculiarly adapted to serve this end .
3570_5694_000013_000001	this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility .
3570_5694_000014_000019	in a heightened degree , therefore , the livery comes to be a badge of servitude , or rather servility .
3570_5695_000001_000001	it is a fact of common observance that in this lower middle class there is no pretense of leisure on the part of the head of the household .
3570_5695_000001_000003	but the middle class wife still carries on the business of vicarious leisure , for the good name of the household and its master .
3570_5695_000002_000000	the leisure rendered by the wife in such cases is , of course , not a simple manifestation of idleness or indolence .
3570_5695_000004_000003	the observance of these standards , in some degree of approximation , becomes incumbent upon all classes lower in the scale .
3570_5695_000004_000010	no class of society , not even the most abjectly poor , forgoes all customary conspicuous consumption .
3570_5695_000004_000011	the last items of this category of consumption are not given up except under stress of the direst necessity .
3570_5695_000005_000001	both are methods of demonstrating the possession of wealth , and the two are conventionally accepted as equivalents .
3570_5695_000005_000003	on grounds of expediency the preference may be given to the one or the other at different stages of the economic development .
3570_5695_000005_000004	the question is , which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect .
3570_5695_000008_000002	the result is that , in order to keep up a decent appearance , the former habitually live hand to mouth to a greater extent than the latter .
3570_5695_000008_000005	but the provocation to this line of evidence , as well as its transient effectiveness , is more decided in the city .
3570_5695_000009_000004	among the latter , everybodys affairs , especially everybodys pecuniary status , are known to everybody else .
3570_5695_000010_000005	at the same time the wages in the trade are high enough to make movement from place to place relatively easy .
3570_5696_000004_000003	the instinct of workmanship is present in all men , and asserts itself even under very adverse circumstances .
3570_5696_000007_000004	a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe .
3575_170457_000010_000007	at first , i could not say thy will be done ! i felt rebellious , but i knew it was wrong to feel so .
3575_170457_000015_000003	whoever , therefore , is ambitious of distinction in this way ought to be prepared for disappointment .
3575_170457_000016_000000	but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent , if you consult your own happiness .
3575_170457_000024_000006	my father is a clergyman of limited , though competent income , and i am the eldest of his children .
3575_170457_000024_000007	he expended quite as much in my education as he could afford in justice to the rest .
3575_170457_000024_000016	that letter is consecrated ; no one shall ever see it , but papa and my brother and sisters .
3575_170457_000031_000002	let me now request that , if you ever should come to these lakes while i am living here , you will let me see you .
3575_170457_000044_000011	i am not good enough for you , and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society .
3575_170457_000046_000001	he refused at first to listen to the careful advice ; it was repugnant to his liberal nature .
3575_170457_000046_000002	but miss branwell persevered ; urged economical motives ; pressed on his love for his daughters .
3729_6852_000008_000001	she held her tongue , but from that time she told everybody that i was an impostor .
3729_6852_000068_000004	therefore it is not a paradox to say that the french would be wiser if they were less witty .
4077_13751_000019_000003	but tools were not wanting , as indeed they never have been , for murder and its kindred outrages .
4077_13754_000003_000005	he was unjustly charged with favoring secession ; but the charge was soon disproved .
4077_13754_000010_000002	but mormonism died not ; every added pang of grief served but to unite the people .
4077_13754_000017_000001	this statement assumes , as granted , a distinction between bigamy and the mormon institution of plural marriage .
4077_13754_000021_000002	and the world is learning , to its manifest surprise , that plural marriage and mormonism are not synonymous terms .
4077_13754_000023_000004	its creed provides for the protection of all men in their rights of worship according to the dictates of conscience .
4446_2271_000001_000006	he had preconceived ideas about everything , and his idea about americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics .
4446_2271_000015_000004	irene burgoyne , one of her family , told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning .
4446_2271_000022_000010	i should torture myself i couldnt help it . after that it was easy to forget , actually to forget .
4446_2271_000023_000011	i shouldnt wonder but theyve probably spoiled her , so that shed be tiresome if one met her again .
4446_2273_000001_000000	on sunday afternoon alexander remembered miss burgoynes invitation and called at her apartment .
4446_2273_000001_000002	hilda lived alone , attended by a very pretty and competent french servant who answered the door and brought in the tea .
4446_2273_000003_000002	for the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled , and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure .
4446_2273_000003_000003	on thursday afternoon he cut short a committee meeting , jumped into a hansom , and drove to bedford square .
4446_2273_000014_000001	i cant tell you how glad i am to have you so pretty and comfortable here , and to hear every one saying such nice things about you .
4446_2273_000015_000003	hes that gifted , you know , but he will drink and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get .
4446_2273_000018_000000	it was a tiny room , hung all round with french prints , above which ran a shelf full of china .
4446_2273_000035_000000	they were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money : god give you a happy love !
4446_2273_000035_000003	they went home sadly with the lilacs , back to the rue saint jacques , walking very slowly , arm in arm .
4446_2273_000043_000002	most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly , so i tried a master ; but he confused me , just !
4446_2273_000045_000000	hilda started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window . its really too warm in this room to sing .
4446_2273_000048_000001	he stood a little behind her , and tried to steady himself as he said : its soft and misty .
4446_2275_000001_000001	the stop at queenstown , the tedious passage up the mersey , were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience .
4446_2275_000002_000004	a coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit , for it was already beginning to grow dark outside .
4446_2275_000009_000001	she looked at his heavy shoulders and big , determined head , thrust forward like a catapult in leash .
4446_2275_000016_000000	he rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room , seeming to find it too small for him .
4446_2275_000018_000000	it . it hasnt always made you miserable , has it ? her eyelids fell and her lips quivered .
4446_2275_000023_000000	could you could you sit down and talk about it quietly , bartley , as if i were a friend , and not some one who had to be defied ?
4446_2275_000030_000000	yes , i was happy , wasnt i ? she pressed his hand gently in gratitude . werent you happy then , at all ?
4446_2275_000033_000000	yes , yes , she hurried , pulling her hand gently away from him . presently it stole back to his coat sleeve .
4446_2275_000038_000006	you want to tell me that you can only see me like this , as old friends do , or out in the world among people ?
4446_2275_000040_000004	what i mean is that i want you to promise never to see me again , no matter how often i come , no matter how hard i beg .
4446_2275_000046_000006	if id met you later , if i hadnt loved you so well but thats all over , long ago .
4446_2275_000047_000001	bartley bent over and took her in his arms , kissing her mouth and her wet , tired eyes .
4507_16021_000022_000000	now , when has horror ever excluded study ?
4507_16021_000025_000005	they are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces ; but slang !
4507_16021_000028_000004	does any one think that alighieri has any fewer things to say than machiavelli ?
4507_16021_000030_000000	man is not a circle with a single centre ; he is an ellipse with a double focus .
4507_16021_000031_000001	there it clothes itself in word masks , in metaphor rags .
4507_16021_000034_000001	it gnashes and whispers , completing the gloom with mystery .
4507_16021_000035_000007	who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice ?
4507_16021_000036_000007	there is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny .
4507_16021_000036_000009	as for the rest of mankind , stagnating night rests upon them .
4507_16021_000037_000001	in this world , evidently the vestibule of another , there are no fortunate .
4507_16021_000039_000000	however , he who says light does not , necessarily , say joy .
4507_16021_000039_000003	to burn without ceasing to fly , therein lies the marvel of genius .
4970_29093_000017_000000	his pen therefore , and whereas , and not as aforesaid , strayed off into other scribbling .
4970_29093_000020_000001	it seemed to him that the newspaper managers didnt want genius , but mere plodding and grubbing .
4970_29093_000028_000000	it was in this time of rather impatient waiting that philip was one morning walking down broadway with henry brierly .
4970_29093_000029_000000	the two were intimate at that time , they had been classmates and saw a great deal of each other .
4970_29093_000044_000000	the night was spent in packing up and writing letters , for philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends .
4970_29093_000044_000002	happy youth , that is ready to pack its valise , and start for cathay on an hours notice .
4970_29093_000049_000001	he knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter .
4970_29093_000050_000006	if he was unsuccessful , or if he never returned perhaps it would be as well .
4970_29095_000003_000006	whatever she thought , she was not idly musing , as one might see by the expression of her face .
4970_29095_000009_000000	if i must say it , mother , i want to go away , and get out of this dead level .
4970_29095_000015_000000	ruth turned square round to her mother , and with an impassive face and not the slightest change of tone , said ,
4970_29095_000018_000002	and the lectures , and the dissecting rooms , has thee thought of the dissecting rooms ?
4970_29095_000035_000000	that evening ruth and her father sat late by the drawing room fire , as they were quite apt to do at night .
4970_29095_000049_000000	i want to be something , to make myself something , to do something .
4970_29095_000049_000002	what one useful thing could i do for a living , for the support of mother and the children ?
4970_29095_000051_000000	somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything , retorted the sharp little disputant .
4970_29095_000054_000000	ruth did not reply directly ; she complained that her mother didnt understand her .
4970_29095_000054_000001	but that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself .
4992_23283_000033_000000	my lord , miss milners taste is not a depraved one ; it is but too refined .
4992_23283_000043_000001	to relieve her from both , he laid his hand with force upon his heart , and said , do you believe me ?
4992_41797_000015_000002	always irritable , cold , indifferent , he had grown rapidly more so as years went on .
4992_41797_000025_000005	shes older than i am , but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child .
4992_41797_000026_000000	have you ever lifted a stone and seen the pale , yellow , stunted shoots of grass under it ?
4992_41806_000009_000000	dont know ; most everything she says sounds like the bible or shakespeare to me .
4992_41806_000010_000001	then nancy handed peter a loosely bound sheaf , saying : to light this fire i give you a torch .
4992_41806_000020_000001	thou who settest the solitary in families , bless the life that is sheltered here .
4992_41806_000025_000001	approaching the dining table , he carefully placed the article in the centre and removed the cloth .
4992_41806_000034_000004	mother carey played the dear old common metre tune , and the voices rang out in whittiers hymn .
5105_28233_000014_000000	and through a storm of shot , not one of which touched the prostrate officer , the troop passed in safety .
5105_28240_000031_000000	i am not sure , said he , but what the tour of the mediterranean will prove to be the tour of the world .
5105_28241_000003_000001	her sea going qualities were excellent , and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe .
5105_28241_000019_000004	but algiers , like all the other coast towns , had apparently been absorbed into the bowels of the earth .
5105_28241_000021_000000	is it not impossible , he murmured aloud , that any city should disappear so completely ?
5105_28241_000024_000000	you must see , lieutenant , i should think , that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined .
5142_33396_000008_000000	this is my vow : i will sail to norway and i will harry the coast and fill my boat with riches .
5142_33396_000010_000000	but others jumped to their feet with their mead horns in their hands . thirty men , one after another , raised their horns and said :
5142_33396_000039_000001	they set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it , and we sat and watched it boil while we joked .
5142_33396_000053_000000	well , after we had been there for a long time , hakon came in to the feast one night and said :
5142_36377_000008_000005	a little cracked that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room .
5142_36377_000010_000006	they pointedly drew back from john jago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table .
5142_36377_000014_000003	she changed color for a moment , and looked at him , with a pretty , reluctant tenderness , as she took her chair .
5142_36586_000011_000001	when an artery is tied , the lateral channels increase not only in diameter , but in the thickness and strength of their coats .
5142_36586_000011_000002	when one kidney ceases to act from disease , the other increases in size , and does double work .
5142_36600_000007_000007	the races differ also in constitution , in acclimatisation and in liability to certain diseases .
5639_40744_000003_000001	rodolfo was now impatient to get rid of leocadia , and made up his mind to lay her in the street , insensible as she was .
5639_40744_000026_000006	if my wife brings me this , i will thank heaven for the gift , and make my parents happy in their old age .
5639_40744_000027_000002	rodolfo thanked her , and supper being ready they went to join the rest of the party at table .
5683_32865_000006_000000	the church yard meteor expired , there was nothing in a moment but his ordinary smile of recognition .
5683_32865_000016_000002	it is such a darling little thing ; and look now is not it magnificent ?
5683_32865_000021_000001	i see to be sure really , wylder , it does your taste infinite credit .
5683_32865_000022_000000	im glad you like it , says wylder , chuckling benignantly on it , over his shoulder .
5683_32865_000028_000000	wylder was laughing rather redly , with the upper part of his face very surly , i thought .
5683_32865_000030_000000	whereupon lake laughed quietly , still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes .
5683_32865_000034_000001	it cant be for money , or balls , or play , and he has no honest business anywhere .
5683_32865_000038_000002	i took a dislike to him at first sight long ago , and that never happened me but i was right .
5683_32865_000045_000000	i believe , charlie , he recommenced suddenly , there is not such an unnatural family on record as ours ; is there ?
5683_32866_000016_000002	she was so unreserved , it seemed , and yet in this directness there was something almost contemptuous .
5683_32866_000028_000000	it is very happy , for her at least , they are not , said rachel , and a long silence ensued .
5683_32866_000039_000005	whatever you meditate , he probably anticipates it you know best and you will find him prepared .
5683_32866_000039_000007	you were always the same , close , dark , and crooked , and wise in your own conceit .
5683_32866_000047_000008	the sombre old trees , like gigantic hearse plumes , black and awful .
5683_32879_000014_000002	you have been more ill than i thought , darling , and you are still far from quite recovered .
5683_32879_000015_000000	rachels pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise .
5683_32879_000016_000000	i shall soon be as well as i am ever likely to be that is , quite well , answered rachel .
5683_32879_000029_000001	i meant to speak to him and end all between us ; and i would now write , but there is no address to his letters .
5683_32879_000040_000000	dorcas , you are changed ; have i lost your love for asking so poor a kindness ?
5683_32879_000042_000002	i have very few to love me now , and i thought you might love me , as i have begun to love you .
5683_32879_000043_000000	and she threw her arms round her cousins neck , and brave rachel at last burst into tears .
5683_32879_000046_000002	thank you , from my heart , for your love ; you will never know , perhaps , how much it is to me .
672_122797_000002_000002	what a nice little fir ! but this was what the tree could not bear to hear .
6829_68769_000005_000004	so this boy was doubly foolish in ruining himself to get sixty dollars to pay an unjust demand .
6829_68769_000006_000000	he was soft hearted and impetuous , said beth ; and , being in love , he didnt stop to count the cost .
6829_68769_000012_000001	he was a round faced , respectable appearing fellow , but his mood was distinctly unsociable .
6829_68769_000030_000000	then he deliberately locked kenneth and beth in with the forger , and retreated along the passage .
6829_68769_000036_000001	he was of sturdy , athletic build and dressed neatly in a suit that was of coarse material but well brushed and cared for .
6829_68769_000051_000002	then rogers wouldnt do anything but lead her around , and wait upon her , and the place went to rack and ruin .
6829_68769_000053_000000	lucy could have looked after her mother , said young bates , but old will was stubborn and wouldnt let her .
6829_68769_000063_000001	it wont be much , but im grateful to find a friend . im guilty , you know , and theres no one to blame but myself .
6829_68769_000073_000000	ive been bothered already over your election campaign , resumed the manager , arranging his papers in a bored manner .
6829_68769_000073_000002	you may as well understand , sir , that i stand for the democratic candidate , and have no sympathy with your side .
6829_68769_000074_000000	that doesnt interest me , especially , sir , answered kenneth , smiling . im not electioneering just now .
6829_68769_000086_000001	ill pay twice sixty dollars for the delivery to me of the forged check , and the withdrawal of the prosecution .
6829_68769_000091_000001	give me a check for a hundred and fifty , and ill turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings .
6829_68769_000100_000001	and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars !
6829_68771_000010_000007	this trading votes , which was often done , was considered by the politicians quite legitimate .
6829_68771_000010_000008	the only thing necessary was to fix seth reynolds , and this hopkins arranged personally .
6829_68771_000012_000001	every scheme known to politicians must be worked , and none knew the intricate game better than hopkins .
6829_68771_000012_000002	this was why he held several long conferences with his friend marshall , the manager at the mill .
6829_68771_000012_000003	and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy .
6829_68771_000015_000000	patsy and beth supported their cousin loyally and assisted in the preparations .
6829_68771_000018_000000	the gardens and grounds were gaily decorated with chinese and japanese lanterns , streamers and forbes banners .
6829_68771_000035_000000	for the first time the maid seemed a little confused , and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor .
6829_68771_000039_000000	she sat down in a rocking chair , and clasping her hands in her lap , rocked slowly back and forth .
6829_68771_000044_000003	her manner was neither independent nor assertive , but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance .
6829_68771_000044_000004	beth felt that she was intruding and knew that she ought to go ; yet some fascination held her to the spot .
6829_68771_000044_000006	however her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness , these hands told a different story .
6829_68771_000046_000001	she rose quickly to her feet , with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath .
6930_76324_000005_000001	i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that picture , but its been of some use , after all .
6930_76324_000026_000003	i just touched something soft ! on the instant , joyce was at her side with the candle .
6930_81414_000014_000003	it did not beckon , or indeed move at all ; it was as still as the hand of death .
7021_79730_000053_000000	in respect to her statement that she was going to the doctors , it may , or may not , have been true .
7021_79740_000011_000000	then , turning to jane , she asked , in a somewhat altered tone , has she been a good girl , jane ?
7021_79740_000020_000000	there ! said she , pointing to the playthings ; see ! all your playthings left out !
7021_79740_000020_000003	they would think that they might do so too , and that would make you a great deal of trouble .
7021_79740_000021_000000	so the children went to work with great alacrity , and put the playthings all away .
7021_85628_000002_000000	once upon a time there was a little boy , called anders , who had a new cap .
7021_85628_000005_000000	the first person he met was a farm labourer walking alongside a load of peat and smacking at his horse .
7021_85628_000009_000000	lets swap caps , he said , and i will give you my jack knife to boot .
7021_85628_000021_000001	for , like as not , they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap .
7021_85628_000025_000000	well , well , give it to me , said the princess , and i will give you a kiss .
7021_85628_000034_000001	he sat as before , and held on to his red cap which everybody was so anxious to get .
7021_85628_000035_000001	he darted like an arrow through all the halls , down all the stairs , and across the yard .
7127_75946_000002_000001	as for the ballet itself , every person knew the part he had to take in it , and how to perform it .
7127_75946_000016_000000	well , sire , the colored lamps , the fireworks , the musicians , and the cooks , have swallowed up four millions in eight days .
7127_75946_000033_000000	i reserve your services for a better occasion ; and believe me , they will only be the better appreciated .
7127_75946_000040_000004	the music , hautboys , flutes , and viols , was delightfully descriptive of rural delights .
7127_75946_000040_000006	he was dressed in a tunic of flowers , which set off his graceful and well formed figure to advantage .
7127_75946_000041_000001	the applause continued so long that the comte had ample leisure to join the king .
7127_75946_000045_000000	far from it , sire ; your majesty having given no directions about it , the musicians have retained it .
7127_75946_000058_000000	every word fell distinctly , in perfect harmony and eloquence , upon louis the fourteenths ears .
7127_75947_000006_000000	the king remained for a moment to enjoy a triumph as complete as it could possibly be .
7127_75947_000006_000009	de guiche , observing that she was alone , near a thicket constructed of painted cloth , approached her .
7127_75947_000007_000000	upon this madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte , observing .
7127_75947_000010_000000	yes ; the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own .
7127_75947_000034_000000	there cannot be a doubt he received you kindly , for , in fact , you returned without his permission .
7127_75947_000071_000000	yes , but if she should have understood , and understood too well , she may talk .
7127_75947_000082_000005	the three young girls , on their side , reached the outskirts of the park , every path of which they well knew .
7176_88083_000002_000004	moreover , he was not in the situation or the surroundings which one is wont to associate with ducks .
7176_88083_000004_000000	the duck was a handsome male of the red breasted merganser family , and the absorbing interest of his life was fish .
7176_88083_000004_000002	here , where the north fork stream fell into the ottanoonsis , was a resort exactly to his liking .
7176_88083_000006_000003	but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls , hawks , and eagles .
7176_88083_000006_000005	had he taken such a prize , he could not have profited by it , having no means of tearing it to pieces .
7176_88083_000010_000002	for all its appalling speed , the sound of his flight was nothing more than a strong pulsating hiss .
7176_88083_000011_000005	it was enough , however , and the unhappy teal was hurled earthward , flapping through the tips of the branches .
7176_88083_000012_000000	as it chanced , however , the victim came down with a thud almost beneath the whiskered nose of the wildcat .
7176_88083_000012_000005	the cat growled softly , picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it .
7176_88083_000013_000002	happily for him , he on his part caught sight of the hawk , and dropped like lead into the torrent .
7176_88083_000015_000003	with only head and wings above the mad smother , he flapped onward frantically , beating down the foam about him .
7176_88083_000017_000005	where the waves for an instant sank , they came closer , but not quite within grasping reach .
7176_88083_000017_000006	the marauder from the upper air was waiting till his quarry should reach less turbulent waters .
7176_88083_000018_000000	a few yards further on , the torrent fell seething over a long ledge into a pool of brief quiet .
7176_88083_000018_000003	the wily drake had plunged with the plunge of the fall itself , and was now darting onward at a safe depth .
7176_88083_000022_000000	just as he made his cast , he saw the fleeing drake and the pursuing hawk come round the bend .
7176_88083_000023_000004	the drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him , and appalling .
7176_88083_000024_000003	he dived and caught it , came to the surface and swallowed it . much refreshed , he looked about him .
7176_92135_000004_000002	it was an unsatisfying life ; and when rash acquaintances asked him what he did , he used to say that he was for the bar .
7176_92135_000006_000006	can you give me a few hints ? suppose you spoke to me like this , then i could do something for you .
7176_92135_000012_000003	of course , a really good actor can often give a clue to the feelings of a character simply by facial expression .
7176_92135_000018_000000	and so on , till you get to the end , when ophelia might say , ah , yes , or something non committal of that sort .
7176_92135_000018_000002	what you want is to make it clear that you are conveying hamlets thoughts to the audience in rather a clever manner .
7176_92135_000055_000000	the answer to this will depend upon the length of the play , for upon the length depends the hour at which the curtain rises .
7176_92135_000056_000002	then the curtain rises , and it is apparent that we are assisting at an at home of considerable splendour .
7176_92135_000070_000002	let your actors have tea by all means , but see that it is a properly histrionic tea .
7729_102255_000010_000014	they were not only well armed and supplied , but wrought up to the highest pitch of partisan excitement .
7729_102255_000012_000001	the people of lawrence , without any great difficulty , obtained daily information concerning the hostile camps .
7729_102255_000012_000007	with the advantage of its defensive position , lawrence was as strong as the sheriffs mob .
7729_102255_000012_000011	the missouri backwoods men manifested an almost incredible interest in this wonderful gun .
7729_102255_000016_000002	the firm defensive attitude of the people of lawrence had produced its effect .
7729_102255_000016_000003	the leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town .
7729_102255_000016_000006	in the missouri camp while the leaders became alarmed the men grew insubordinate .
7729_102255_000016_000008	the forces of the lecompton camp fully understand the plot and will fight under the same banner .
7729_102255_000018_000006	neither party was willing to yield honestly nor ready to fight manfully .
7729_102255_000021_000000	the truce patched up by this lawrence treaty was of comparatively short duration .
7729_102255_000025_000003	the people of lawrence denounced the deed ; but the sheriff hoarded up the score for future revenge .
7729_102255_000028_000004	their distinctive characters , however , display one broad and unfailing difference .
7729_102255_000028_000008	their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities .
7729_102255_000034_000005	ten days were consumed in these negotiations ; but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield .
7729_102255_000035_000001	he continued his pretended search and , to give color to his errand , made two arrests .
7729_102255_000035_000006	the military force , partly rabble , partly organized , had meanwhile moved into the town .
7729_102255_000036_000005	the inmates being removed , at the appointed hour a few cannon balls were fired through the stone walls .
8224_274384_000005_000001	he was particularly attentive to the behavior of their preachers , on whom all depended .
8224_274384_000006_000000	why dost thou , tyrant , boast thyself , thy wicked deeds to praise ?
8224_274384_000017_000002	yet were they little worse than what were insisted on before the battle of naseby .
8230_279154_000002_000000	memory , which we are to consider to day , introduces us to knowledge in one of its forms .
8230_279154_000004_000006	how , then , are we to find any way of comparing the present image and the past sensation ?
8230_279154_000004_000009	in this way the whole status of images as copies is bound up with the analysis of memory .
8230_279154_000007_000000	i am not suggesting that the non existence of the past should be entertained as a serious hypothesis .
8230_279154_000011_000001	it might be suggested that vagueness is the required characteristic , but i do not think this is the case .
8230_279154_000011_000003	in such a case we distrust our image in spite of its being unusually clear .
8230_279154_000011_000005	some images , like some sensations , feel very familiar , while others feel strange .
8230_279154_000017_000002	but the rejection of the subject renders some more complicated theory necessary .
8230_279154_000017_000003	remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling , or related to , what is remembered .
8230_279154_000018_000000	some points may be taken as fixed , and such as any theory of memory must arrive at .
8230_279154_000018_000005	nevertheless , in spite of the risk of error , precision is the goal at which we must aim .
8230_279154_000019_000000	the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past .
8230_279154_000021_000003	these considerations , however , are taking us away from psychology , to which we must now return .
8230_279154_000022_000007	when we have once described the event , the words we have used easily become habitual .
8230_279154_000024_000000	the sort of memory with which we are here concerned is the sort which is a form of knowledge .
8230_279154_000027_000002	we recognize our friend jones , we know cats and dogs when we see them , and so on .
8455_210777_000003_000004	and what hope had there been , what reasonable expectation , that the system should have been allowed fair play ?
8455_210777_000012_000002	i must by no means show in such company as was now present the strong feeling which pervaded my own mind .
8455_210777_000014_000000	this was a pretty little speech enough , and received the eager compliments of the officers of the john bright .
8455_210777_000015_000000	jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to eva , and was now reduced to silence by his praises .
8455_210777_000022_000005	when the president of the republic has his health drunk , it is , i conceive , his duty to do so .
8455_210777_000034_000000	and that in opposition to the wishes , as i understand , of a large proportion of your fellow citizens ?
8455_210777_000040_000000	and you are , i am aware , sufficiently popular with the people here to enable you to do so ?
8455_210777_000049_000001	i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere , or drowned upon the voyage , it mattered not which .
8455_210777_000050_000001	now , at the close of the twentieth century , could oppression be carried to such a height as this ?
8455_210777_000053_000000	lieutenant crosstrees has sealed orders , and is practically acquainted with the mechanism of the gun .
8455_210777_000061_000004	the country has since undoubtedly prospered , and in a material point of view has given us no grounds for regret .
8455_210777_000079_000002	all this i could hardly explain to him , as i should thus be giving to him the strongest evidence against my own philosophy .
8463_287645_000003_000002	nor was he all muscle by a great deal ; he was well balanced as to mother wit and shrewdness .
8463_287645_000024_000000	when asked what first prompted him to seek his freedom , he replied , oh my senses !
8463_287645_000030_000001	he hated everything like slavery , and as young as he was , he had already made five attempts to escape .
8463_294825_000018_000001	the poles were quashed with a violence that appalled not only verne but all europe .
8463_294825_000030_000000	because , as that time cover story suggests , we still havent caught up with verne .
8463_294825_000030_000001	even in our era of satellite dishes and video games , the seas keep their secrets .
8463_294828_000014_000000	even so , i had just returned from an arduous journey , exhausted and badly needing a rest .
8463_294828_000021_000000	the lad was thirty years old , and his age to that of his employer was as fifteen is to twenty .
8463_294828_000022_000001	he was a fanatic on formality , and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it got tiresome .
8463_294828_000038_000000	yes , we are . certainly , i replied evasively , but after we make a detour .
8463_294828_000047_000001	i left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris , france .
8463_294828_000067_000000	lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river , at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city .
8555_284447_000008_000000	so ho ! roared the monarch , you thought you could defy me , earth clod , did you ?
8555_284447_000010_000001	my guards are not to be trusted , and i dont mean to let you out of my sight again until you are patched .
8555_284447_000012_000001	no one could see her , so no one not even capn bill knew she was there .
8555_284447_000013_000001	invisible trot followed soberly after them , still wondering what she could do to save her friend .
8555_284447_000018_000000	the room of the great knife was high and big , and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon .
8555_284447_000018_000003	therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her .
8555_284447_000020_000002	these plumes waved gracefully in the air with every mincing step the princesses took .
8555_284447_000033_000003	go and capture the first living creature you see , and bring him here to be patched to capn bill .
8555_284447_000036_000000	suddenly there was a noise in the corridor and evidence of scuffling and struggling .
8555_284447_000047_000000	the soldiers again rolled the frame in position , having first pulled the great knife once more to the top of the derrick .
8555_284447_000048_000000	when all was in readiness the king pulled the cord a second time and trot at the same instant pulled upon her rope .
8555_284447_000064_000000	youll take it easy , cause you cant help yourself , said capn bill . what next , queen trot ?
