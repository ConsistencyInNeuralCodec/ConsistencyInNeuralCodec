1089_134686_000002_000001	After early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter of the brothels.
1089_134686_000007_000005	The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space.
1089_134686_000009_000003	The chaos in which his ardor extinguished itself was a cold and different knowledge of himself.
1089_134686_000009_000008	What did it avail to pray when he knew that his soul lusted after its own destruction?
1089_134686_000015_000003	The bell rang the master marked the sums, and cuts to be done for the next lesson and went out.
1089_134686_000024_000002	The philemon, in giving baptism, pour the water before saying the words as the child baptized.
1089_134686_000026_000003	A gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.
1089_134686_000028_000004	The Mass will be on Saturday morning at 9 o'clock in General Communion for the whole college.
1089_134686_000030_000000	A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the rector's grim smile.
1089_134686_000030_000001	Stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fold with fear like a withering flower.
1089_134686_000032_000006	He is said to have baptized as many as 10,000 idolaters in one month.
1089_134691_000004_000000	Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea, as he had read from her listless silence a
1089_134691_000006_000000	whose feet are as the feet of hearts and underneath the everlasting arms.
1089_134691_000007_000000	The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused.
1089_134691_000013_000004	No, it was not their colors with the poison balance of the period itself.
1089_134691_000015_000000	A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river was inbade.
1089_134691_000025_000002	Perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls.
1089_134691_000027_000000	Their banter was not new to him, and now it flattered his mild proud sovereignty.
1089_134691_000039_000000	He started up nervously from the stone block, for he could no longer quench the flame in his blood.
1089_134691_000042_000001	Emerald and black and rusted and all of it moved beneath the current, swaying and turning.
1089_134691_000042_000002	The world is the river of restlessness.
1089_134691_000045_000004	Her slate blue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her.
1089_134691_000047_000000	Heavenly God, cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of profane joy.
1089_134691_000049_000002	to leered, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life.
1089_134691_000054_000000	Evening had fallen, and he woke, and the sand and arid grasses of his bed glowed no longer.
1188_133604_000024_000000	But in this vignette, copied from Turner, you have the two principles brought out perfectly.

121_127105_000007_000003	Bessie took for a sign that he had himself something to produce, and that we should only have to wait.
121_127105_000012_000000	He said it was not so simple as that, to be really at a loss how to qualify it.
121_127105_000014_000000	No notice of her. He looked at me, but as if instead of me he saw what he spoke of.
121_127105_000016_000000	he turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an instant.
121_127105_000018_000001	I took that here," he tapped his ass.
121_127105_000020_000004	But if he'd put the inference by wither to smile, it was also without irritation.
121_127105_000020_000009	Oh yes, don't grin, I liked her extremely, and am glad to this day to think she liked me too.

121_127105_000044_000003	The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations, and that his own affairs took up all his time.

1284_1180_000020_000000	I never knew why I was called the Unlucky," said Aokiya Sabomi, but it is really a good name for me.
1284_1180_000023_000000	I do not know how, but you must keep the matter in mind, and perhaps the chance will come to you," she replied.
1284_1180_000027_000000	We're traveling," replied Ojo, and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves.
1284_1180_000045_000002	But what is that? Ojo asked, for this seemed even more strange and unusual than a glass cat.
1284_1180_000053_000001	I will show you what a good job I did." And she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors.
1284_1181_000027_000000	This powder must not be used before tomorrow morning, but I think it is now cool enough to be bottled.
1284_1181_000028_000001	Very carefully he placed the Powder of Life and the gold ballil, and then locked it up in a drawer of his cabinet.

1320_122612_000006_000004	At last the scout spoke in English and at once explained the embarrassment of their situation.
1320_122612_000020_000001	A circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion.
1320_122612_000021_000000	Such cunning is not without its deviltry exclaimed Hawkeye when he met the disappointed looks of his assistants.
1320_122612_000029_000000	The whole party now proceeded, following the course of the reel, keeping anxious eyes on irregular impressions.
1320_122612_000033_000000	Softly, softly. We know our path, but it is good to examine the formation of things.
1320_122612_000037_000001	See, the heel has hardly touched the ground, and there the dark hair has made a little jump from root to root.
1320_122612_000037_000002	No, no, nigh knowledge for it, neither of them was nigh fainting here away.
1320_122612_000051_000001	Do you keep him under your rifle while I creep in your hind through the bush and take him alive?
1320_122612_000056_000003	Having reached within a few yards of the narter, he arose to his feet, silently and slowly.
1320_122617_000043_000001	So, Uncas, you had better take the lead, while I will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed.
1580_141083_000006_000000	My friend's temper had not improved, since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street.
1580_141083_000006_000001	Without his scrap-books, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man.
1580_141083_000008_000004	I, however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I left the proof upon my desk.
1580_141083_000009_000002	For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling my pocket I found that it was all right.
1580_141083_000012_000000	The first page on the floor, the second the window, the third where you left it," said
1580_141083_000015_000000	For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers.
1580_141083_000015_000002	The alternative was that some one passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to let the papers.
1580_141083_000016_000006	Evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it.
1580_141083_000017_000000	Excellent!" said Holmes, who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.
1580_141083_000018_000004	Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.
1580_141083_000047_000007	He carried them over to the window-table, because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect an escape.
1580_141083_000056_000006	I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface.
1580_141083_000061_000001	As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs.
1580_141083_000063_000000	It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuffs, exactly like the one upon the table of the study.
1580_141083_000066_000002	What could he do? He got rid of everything which would betray him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.
1580_141083_000070_000000	LATEST PANT LEAD FRAMEWORK THREE SEPARATE WINDOWS, ONE SWINGING AND HINGE, AND LARGE ENOUGH TO ADMIT A MAN
1580_141083_000081_000003	His father was the notorious Ser Giappas Gilchrist, still ruined himself on the turf.
1580_141084_000009_000001	A tall, flakes-and-haired, slim young fellow opened it and made us welcome when he understood our errand.
1580_141084_000009_000007	The outer door would not open to our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it.
1580_141084_000029_000001	All were acquired that one could be ordered, but that it was not a usual size of pencil, and that it was seldom kept in stock.
1580_141084_000029_000002	My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation.
1580_141084_000031_000000	Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner.
1580_141084_000044_000000	The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers.
1580_141084_000069_000001	He was a fine figure of a man, tall, loud, and agile, with a springy step and a pleasant open face.
1580_141084_000071_000000	The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look full of horror and reproach at Bannister.
1580_141084_000075_000000	"'Kad,' said Holmes kindly, "'it is human to err, and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.'
1580_141084_000077_000003	He was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see as he passed what papers were on the central table.
1580_141084_000077_000004	I am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one less than that would have a chance.
1580_141084_000078_000001	Of the center table I could make nothing until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long-distance jumper.
1580_141084_000079_000002	As he passed your window he saw, By means of his great height, These proofs upon your table, And conjectured what they were.
1580_141084_000079_000005	It was not a dangerous exploit, for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question.
1580_141084_000082_000007	You observe that the scratch in that table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door.
1995_1826_000016_000011	She wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of Kyphilanthropies and reforms.
1995_1826_000022_000001	Miss Taylor did not know much about cotton, but at least one more remark seemed called for.
1995_1826_000056_000000	She started thinking of cotton, but at once she pulled herself back to the other aspect.
1995_1836_000003_000002	At last the cotton combined was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the Senate.
1995_1836_000019_000000	But Creswell added significantly, capacity differs enormously between races.
1995_1837_000010_000005	To her all things meant something nothing was aimless. Nothing nearly happened.
1995_1837_000011_000002	Perhaps if the water had but drained from Mekhain, he was so strong and tall, but Pishaw.
1995_1837_000012_000003	The raindrops were still dripping and gleaming from the trees, flashing back the heavy yellow sunlight.
1995_1837_000019_000001	The cotton crop was short and poor because of the great rain, but the sun had saved the best and the price had soared.
1995_1837_000021_000002	The sun, the swamp, then finding a whale. She closed her eyes and slept.
1995_1837_000026_000002	He came down to her, slowly, with fixed, hungry eyes, threading his way amid the fleece.
2300_131720_000003_000001	It went into service August 15, 1882, about three weeks before the Pearl Street Station.
2300_131720_000004_000006	Why, if we erect a station at the falls, it is a great economy to get it up to the city.
2300_131720_000004_000012	Burbank and his tribe represent an invegetable world. Edison and the mechanical...
2300_131720_000006_000001	Every department of mechanics was stimulated and benefited to an extraordinary degree.
2300_131720_000008_000007	I requested him to make a sheet brass oil cup and solder it to the base I had.
2300_131720_000008_000009	I then had our standard made to hold another oil cup. So I asked to see and regulate the drop feed.
2300_131720_000016_000012	They found an engine somewhat loose in the bearings and their followed remarks which would not look well in print.
2300_131720_000019_000001	At this time and long after, all arc lighting was done on a flat rate basis.
2300_131720_000020_000008	Hence, the Edison electrolytic miller is no longer used, despite its excellent qualities.
2300_131720_000023_000003	The meter continued in general service during 1899 and probably up to the close of the century.
2300_131720_000025_000007	A heat from this lamp would prevent the liquid from freezing so that the meter could go on doing its duty.
2300_131720_000026_000000	After the station had been running several months and was technically a success, we began to look after the financial part.
2300_131720_000026_000007	They said they were sorry, that is, Wall Street sorry and refused to pay it.
2300_131720_000032_000005	the investors in the enterprise were ready and anxious to meet the extra cost of putting the wires underground.
2300_131720_000034_000005	One evening there came a sudden flash of fire and a spluttering, sizzling noise.
2300_131720_000039_000007	We had two wire underground feeders sent in without any plans or specifications for their installation.
2300_131720_000040_000005	Among the exhibits of that exposition was the Edison system of incandescent lighting.
2300_131720_000042_000002	The machinery was taken up in pieces on the backs of mules from the foot of the mountain.
237_126133_000002_000004	It got to be noticed finally, and why, and all redoubled their exertions to make everything twice as pleasant as ever.
237_126133_000015_000001	Somehow, of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day, it seemed as if she could bear it no longer.
237_126133_000021_000000	Like this, the bundle opened suddenly, and out popped Francie,
237_126133_000024_000000	"'Are too glad ants pum, Polly?' asked Fernsie with her little face close to Polly's own.
237_126133_000028_000000	Is her name Francie? Put in Dick unwilling to be left out, and not thinking of anything else to ask.
237_126133_000029_000000	Boys, whispered dear mother, warlingly, she can't answer you, just look at her face.
237_126133_000034_000000	"'I know,' cast Polly, controlling her sobs. I won't only I can't thank you."
237_126133_000043_000000	So you must, cried Jasper, enchanted that his success in a million el go with you.
237_126133_000046_000000	"'Are you franzy?' cried Bollie, turning around at the last words. "'How could you?'
237_134493_000002_000002	Could he rise from beneath it? He would not know the country under which he has been asleep.
237_134493_000002_000003	The shaggy coat of the prairie which they lifted to make him a bed has vanished for ever.
237_134493_000004_000003	The air and the earth are curiously meh-ted and intermingled, as if the one were the breath of the other.
237_134493_000007_000000	When he had been mowing the bitter part of an hour, he heard the rattle of a light cart on the road behind him.
237_134493_000007_000001	Supposing that it was his sister coming back from one of her farms, he kept on with his work.
237_134493_000011_000000	Lots of the Bohemian boys at the University are," said Emil, taking up his scythe again.
237_134493_000013_000001	Mary, there's no denying you're a spunky little bunch, he checks he pulled back over his shoulder.
237_134493_000017_000001	Oh, there's a good boy!" She turned her head to him with a quick, bright smile.
237_134493_000021_000001	There were so many sheds and outbuildings grouped about it that the place looked a lot like a tiny village.
237_134493_000021_000002	A stranger, approaching it, could not help noticing the beauty and fruitfulness of the outlying fields.
237_134493_000021_000003	There was something individual about the great farm, a most unusual trimness and care for detail.
237_134493_000022_000001	One room is papered, carpeted, over furnished. The next is almost bare.
237_134500_000001_000002	One of the Gauls was getting a divorce, and Frank took it as a personal affront.
237_134500_000001_000004	Cheng read English slowly, and the more he laughed at this divorce case, the angrier he grew.
237_134500_000003_000004	Frank and Lou Berkson had very similar ideas and they were two of the political agitators of the county.
237_134500_000014_000002	Thing like good cath, yep.
237_134500_000015_000000	That's up what we're saying said Eniel, stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass.
237_134500_000016_000002	I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do.
237_134500_000022_000000	Ozo, you know what I mean." Myrrhine tossed her head. Impatiently, does she really care about him?
237_134500_000023_000000	Who, Alexandra?" Emil laughed and thrust his hands into his trousers' pockets.
237_134500_000031_000000	And there are so many, many things I can't do, Emile." I code her tone sarcastically.
237_134500_000032_000001	I wish you weren't so restless and didn't get so worked up over things," she said sadly.
237_134500_000036_000003	And anyhow, there's nothing to understand. She struck the ground with her little foot fiercely.
237_134500_000036_000005	It will go away, and things will be just as they used to. I wish you were a Catholic.
260_123286_000005_000001	He examines the horizon all round with his eyes and folds his arms with the ear of an injured man.
260_123286_000007_000000	You seem anxious, my uncle, I said, seeing him continually with his glass to his eye.
260_123286_000013_000000	I then remembered that the professor before starting had estimated the length of this underground sea at 30 lilings.
260_123286_000020_000000	I take this as my answer and I leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience.
260_123286_000021_000005	I was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric light should grow dim or fail altogether.
260_123286_000031_000003	They possess the perfect organization, gigantic proportions, prodigious strength.
260_123286_000033_000003	Yet the deep marks of conical teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.
260_123286_000034_000003	What, that nary bad notion that was of his, I thought to myself to take soundings just here.
260_123286_000038_000001	The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms.
260_123286_000045_000001	We stood amazed thunderstruck at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters.
260_123286_000047_000001	The reptiles rose. They wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains.
260_123286_000057_000001	Two monsters only were creating all this commotion, and before my eyes of two repriles of the primal world.
260_123288_000004_000001	The atmosphere is charged with vapors, pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters.
260_123288_000006_000000	In the distance, the clouds resemble great bales of cotton, piled up in picturesque disorder.
260_123288_000023_000005	My eyes fail under the dazzling light. My ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder.
260_123288_000023_000006	I must be bound to the mast which bows like a raid before the mighty strength of the storm.
260_123288_000040_000000	A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air, it airs the throat, it fills the lungs.
260_123288_000045_000004	We have been carried under England, under the Channel, under France, perhaps under the whole of Europe.
260_123440_000010_000002	And yesterday things went on just as usual I wonder if I've been changed in the night
260_123440_000018_000002	That would be a queer thing to be sure however Everything is queer today
260_123440_000023_000001	And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
260_123440_000024_000002	Our family always hated cats, nasty, low, vulgar things.
2830_3979_000018_000000	The reformer had lectured on this epistle of St. Paul's in 1519 and again in 1523.
2830_3979_000018_000002	In his table talks the saying is recorded, the epistle to the Galatians is my epistle.
2830_3979_000018_000006	The lectures which are preserved in the works here was submitted to the American public were delivered in the 1531.
2830_3979_000023_000000	Glory to God in the hottest and on earth peace goodwill to men
2830_3980_000017_000001	Do you suppose that God, for the sake of a few Lutheran, Radix would disown his entire church?
2830_3980_000018_000000	Against these boasting false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority in ministry.
2830_3980_000018_000002	He reminds them of the time when he opposed Peter to his face and reproved the chief of the apostles.
2830_3980_000021_000000	Every minister should make much of his calling and impress upon others the fact that he has been delegated by God to preach the gospel.
2830_3980_000022_000002	Paul exalts his ministry out of the desire to make name the name the grace and the mercy of God
2961_961_000008_000000	Socrates, excellent Timaeus, I like your manner of approaching the subject to see.
2961_961_000011_000000	Are there any worlds, all and in world? That is the fourth question, one only.
2961_961_000020_000001	Engar created them according to the bodies, or species of them which existed in the divine original.
2961_961_000023_000007	And when exterminate impressions enter them, they are really conquered, though they seem to conquer.
2961_961_000024_000002	This, however, is an after-stage at present. We are only concerned with creation of the body and soul.
3570_5694_000007_000005	Insanities induced by overindulgence are among some peoples freely recognized as manly attributes.
3570_5694_000007_000009	This invidious traditional distinction has not lost its force even among the more advanced peoples of today.
3570_5694_000010_000001	He is no longer simply the successful, aggressive male, the man of strength, resource, and intrepidity.
3570_5694_000011_000004	Costly entertainments, such as the potlatch or the ball, are peculiarly adapted to serve this end.
3570_5694_000013_000001	This differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility.
3570_5694_000014_000019	and a heightened degree, and therefore, delivery comes to be a badge of servitude, or rather civility.
3570_5695_000001_000001	It is a fact of common observance that in this lower middle class there is no pretense of leisure on the part of the head of the household.
3570_5695_000001_000003	But the middle-class wife still carries on the business of vicarious leisure, for the good name of the household and its master.
3570_5695_000002_000000	The leisure rendered by the wife in such cases is, of course, not the simple manifestation of idleness or ignorance.
3570_5695_000004_000003	The observance of these standards in some degree of approximation becomes incumbent upon all classes lower in the scale.
3570_5695_000004_000010	No class of society, not even the most abjectly poor, forgoes all customary conspicuous consumption.
3570_5695_000004_000011	The last items of this category of consumption are not given up except under stress of the direst necessity.
3570_5695_000005_000001	Both are methods of demonstrating the possession of wealth and the two are conventionally accepted as equivalents.
3570_5695_000005_000003	On grounds of expediency, the preference may be given to me one or the other at different stages of the economic development.
3570_5695_000005_000004	The question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect.
3570_5695_000008_000002	The result is that in order to keep up a detent appearance, the former habitually leave hand to mouth to a greater extent than the latter.
3570_5695_000008_000005	But the provocation to this line of evidence, as well as its transient effectiveness, is more decided in the city.
3570_5695_000009_000004	Among Malata, everybody's affairs, especially everybody's pecuniary status, are known to everybody else.
3570_5695_000010_000005	At the same time the wages in the trade are high enough to make movement from place to place relatively easy.
3570_5696_000004_000003	The instinct of workmanship is present in all men, and asserts itself even under very adverse circumstances.
3570_5696_000007_000004	A reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make-believe.
3575_170457_000010_000007	At first, I could not say that I will be dying while I felt rebellious, but I knew it is wrong to feel so.
3575_170457_000015_000003	Whoever, therefore, is ambitious of distinction in this way ought to be prepared for disappointment.
3575_170457_000016_000000	But it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent, if you consult your own happiness.
3575_170457_000024_000006	My father is a clergyman of limited, though confident, income, and I am the eldest of his children.
3575_170457_000024_000007	He expended quite as much in my education as he could afford and justice to the rest.
3575_170457_000024_000016	That letter is consecrated, no one shall ever see it, but Papa and to my Berber ancestors.
3575_170457_000031_000002	Let me now request that, if you ever should come to these lakes while I am living here, you will let me see you.
3575_170457_000044_000011	I'm not enough for you, and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society.
3575_170457_000046_000001	He refused at first to listen to the careful advice. It was repugnant to his liberal nature.
3575_170457_000046_000002	But Miss Branwell persevered, urged, economical motives pressed, and his love for his daughters.
3729_6852_000008_000001	She held her tongue. But from that time she told everybody that I was an imposter.
3729_6852_000068_000004	Therefore, it is not a paradox to say that the French would be wiser if they were less witty.
4077_13751_000019_000003	but tools were not wanting, as indeed they never have been for murder in its kindred outrages.
4077_13754_000003_000005	He was unjustly charged to a favouring secession, but the charge was soon disproved.
4077_13754_000010_000002	But Mormonism died not. The re-added panning of grief served but to unite the people.
4077_13754_000017_000001	This statement assumes, as granted, a distinction between bigamy and the Mormon institution of plural marriage.
4077_13754_000021_000002	The world is learning to have learned of his surprise that plural marriage and Mormonism are not synonymous terms.
4077_13754_000023_000004	Its creed provides for the protection of all men, and their rights of worship according to the dictates of conscience.
4446_2271_000001_000006	He had preconceived ideas about everything and his ideas about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics.
4446_2271_000015_000004	Irene Burgoyne wanted her family to remain confident that there was a them-ass somewhere back in the beginning.
4446_2271_000022_000010	I should torture myself I couldn't help it after that that easy to forget actually to forget
4446_2271_000023_000011	I shouldn't wonder but they probably spoiled her so that should be tiresome of when met her again
4446_2273_000001_000000	On Sunday afternoon, Alexander remembered Ms. Burgoyne's invitation and called at her apartment.
4446_2273_000001_000002	Hilda lived and longed, attended by a very pretty and competent French servant who answered the door and brought him the tea.
4446_2273_000003_000002	For the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure.
4446_2273_000003_000003	On Thursday afternoon, he cut short a committee meeting, jumped into a Hanson, and drove to Bedford Square.
4446_2273_000014_000001	I'd like to tell you how glad I am to have you so pretty and comfortable here, and to hear everyone saying such nice things about you.
4446_2273_000015_000003	He's that gifted, you know, but he would drink and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever did.
4446_2273_000018_000000	It was a tiny room hung all around with French prints above which ran a shelf with China
4446_2273_000035_000000	He worked day for remembering what the woman had said, then she took the money. God give you a happy love.
4446_2273_000035_000003	They went home sadly with the lilacs, back to the Rue Saint-Jacques, walking very slowly arm in arm.
4446_2273_000043_000002	Most accurate is 90 days learned to sing properly. Do I try to master? Bunny can
4446_2273_000045_000000	Helva started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window that she literally wore in this room to sing.
4446_2273_000048_000001	He stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said, it's soft and misty.
4446_2275_000001_000001	Fist off at Queenstown, the tedious passage of the mercy whippings that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
4446_2275_000002_000004	The coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside.
4446_2275_000009_000001	She looked at her heady shoulders and big, determined hair, brushed forward like the catapult and leashed
4446_2275_000016_000000	He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room seeming to find it too small for him.
4446_2275_000018_000000	And it hasn't always made you miserable, has it, her eyelids fell and her lips quivered?
4446_2275_000023_000000	Could you could you sit down and talk about it quietly, barkly, as if I were a friend, and not someone who had to be defied?
4446_2275_000030_000000	Yes, I was happy wasn't I she pressed his hand gently and gratitude weren't you happy that at all?
4446_2275_000033_000000	Yes, she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it still backed his coat sleeve.
4446_2275_000038_000006	You want to tell me that you can only see me like this at all friends do were out in the world among people
4446_2275_000040_000004	What I mean is that I want to the progress never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg.
4446_2275_000046_000006	without yet you'd measure, if I hadn't loved you so well. But that's all over long ago.
4446_2275_000047_000001	Artie Billy Bull and Toot Pearl is orange, kissing him long in her wet tired eyes.
4507_16021_000022_000000	Now, when has horror ever excluded study?
4507_16021_000025_000005	They are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces but slang.
4507_16021_000028_000004	Does anyone think that a Lahiri has any fewer things to say than Machiavelli?
4507_16021_000030_000000	Man is not a circle with a single center. He is an ellipse with a double focus.
4507_16021_000031_000001	Dare it close itself in word masks, in metaphor rags.
4507_16021_000034_000001	It gnashes and whispers, completing the gloom with mystery.
4507_16021_000035_000007	who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice.
4507_16021_000036_000007	There is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny.
4507_16021_000036_000009	As for the rest of mankind, sagnating night rests upon them.
4507_16021_000037_000001	In this world, evidently the vestibule of another, there are no fortunate
4507_16021_000039_000000	However, he who sees light does not necessarily see joy.
4507_16021_000039_000003	To burn without ceasing to fly, Land lies the marvel of genius.
4970_29093_000017_000000	His pen therefore, and whereas, and not as aforesaid, strayed off into other scribbling.
4970_29093_000020_000001	It seemed to him that the newspaper managers didn't want genius, but mere plotting and grubbing.
4970_29093_000028_000000	and was in this time a rather impatient waiting at Philippe's one morning balking down Broadway with Henry Brarley.
4970_29093_000029_000000	The two were intimate at that time. They had been classmates and saw a great deal of each other.
4970_29093_000044_000000	The night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends.
4970_29093_000044_000002	Happy youth that is ready to pack its voles and start for Kaffir and an hour's notice.
4970_29093_000049_000001	He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.
4970_29093_000050_000006	If he was unsuccessful, or if he never returned perhaps it would be as well.
4970_29095_000003_000006	Whatever she thought, she was not idly musing as one might see by the expression of her face.
4970_29095_000009_000000	If I must say it, mother, I want to go away and get out of this devil level.
4970_29095_000015_000000	Ruth turned square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and not the slightest change of tone, said,
4970_29095_000018_000002	and the lectures, and the dissecting rooms has the thought of the dissecting rooms?
4970_29095_000035_000000	That evening Ruth and her father sat late by the drawing-room fire as they were quite apt to do at night.
4970_29095_000049_000000	I want to be something, to make myself something, to do something.
4970_29095_000049_000002	What one useful thing could I do for a living for the support of mother and the children?
4970_29095_000051_000000	"'Somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything,' retorted the sharp little disputant.
4970_29095_000054_000000	Ruth did not reply directly. She complained that her mother didn't understand her.
4970_29095_000054_000001	But Bite-Wise and Placid Woman understood the sweet rubble a great deal better than Ruth understood herself.
4992_23283_000033_000000	My lord, Miss Milner's taste is not a depraved one. It is but too refined.
4992_23283_000043_000001	To relieve her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said,
4992_41797_000015_000002	Always irrible, cold, and differ. He had grown rapidly more so as years went on.
4992_41797_000025_000005	She was older than I am, but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child.
4992_41797_000026_000000	Have you ever lifted a stone and seen the pear-yell, stunted shoots of grass under it?
4992_41806_000009_000000	Don't know, most everything she says sounds like the Bible or Shakespeare to me.
4992_41806_000010_000001	The Nancy-handed Peter, a loosely bound sheaf, Siring delight this fire,
4992_41806_000020_000001	Thou who set us the solitary in Pharaonese, Bless them life that is sheltered here.
4992_41806_000025_000001	approaching the dining table. He carefully placed the article in the center and removed the cloth.
4992_41806_000034_000004	Mother Terry played the dear old comet-matter tune, and the voices rang out in what ears him.
5105_28233_000014_000000	and through a storm of shot, not one of which touched the prostrate officer, the troop passed in safety.
5105_28240_000031_000000	I am not sure," said he, but what the tour of the Mediterranean Wing will prove to be the tour of the world.
5105_28241_000003_000001	Our seagull equalities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe.
5105_28241_000019_000004	But Algiers, like all the other coast towns, had apparently been absorbed into the bowels of the earth.
5105_28241_000021_000000	Is it not impossible, he murmured aloud, that any city should disappear so completely?
5105_28241_000024_000000	You must see, Lieutenant, I should think, that we are not so near the coast of Algeria as you imagined.
5142_33396_000008_000000	This is my vow, I will sail to Norway, And I will harry the coast and fill my boat with riches.
5142_33396_000010_000000	But others jumped to their feet with their mead horns in their hands thirty men, one after another, raised their horns and said,
5142_33396_000039_000001	They set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it, and we sat and watched it boil while we joked.
5142_33396_000053_000000	Well, after we had been there for a long time, Hacking came into the feast one night and said,
5142_36377_000008_000005	A little crack that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger, whom now made his appearance in the supper-room.
5142_36377_000010_000006	They pointedly drew back from John Iago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table.
5142_36377_000014_000003	She changed color for a moment and looked at him with a pretty reluctant tenderness as she took her chair.
5142_36586_000011_000001	When an artery is tied, the lateral alginals increase not only in diameter, but in the thickness and strength of their coats.
5142_36586_000011_000002	When one kidney ceases to act from disease, the other increases in size and does double work.
5142_36600_000007_000007	The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatization, and in liability to certain diseases.
5639_40744_000003_000001	Rodolfo was now impatient to get rid of Laicardia and made up his mind to lay her in the street, insensible as she was.
5639_40744_000026_000006	When my wife brings me this, I will thank heaven for the gift and make my parents happy in their old age.
5639_40744_000027_000002	Rodolfo thanked her, and supper being ready. They went to join the rest of the party at table.
5683_32865_000006_000000	The churchyard meteor expired. There was nothing in a moment but its ordinary smile of recognition.
5683_32865_000016_000002	That is such a darling little thing.
5683_32865_000021_000001	They seem to be sure really wilder. It does you taste infinite credit.
5683_32865_000022_000000	"'Am glad you like it,' says Wilder, chuckling benignly on it over his shoulder.
5683_32865_000028_000000	Wilder was laughing rather readily, with the upper part of his face very surly, I thought.
5683_32865_000030_000000	Where a paring lake lashed quietly, Still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.
5683_32865_000034_000001	That can't be for money or balls or play and he has no honest business anywhere
5683_32865_000038_000002	I took a dislike to him at first sight long ago, and that never happened to me, but I was right.
5683_32865_000045_000000	I believe, Charlie," he recommends. Suddenly. There is not such an unnatural family on record as ours is there.
5683_32866_000016_000002	She was so unreserved. It seemed, and yet this directness was something almost contemptuous.
5683_32866_000028_000000	It is very happy, or at least they are not," said Rachel, and a long silence ensued
5683_32866_000039_000005	Whatever you meditate, he probably anticipates it. You know best, and you will find him prepared.
5683_32866_000039_000007	You are always the same, close, dark, and crooked, and wise in your own conceit.
5683_32866_000047_000008	The somber old trees, they looked like a cursed gloom, black and awful.
5683_32879_000014_000002	You have been more ill than I thought, darling, and you are still far from quite recovered.
5683_32879_000015_000000	Rachel's pale and sharpened features, and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise
5683_32879_000016_000000	"'I shall soon be as well as I am ever likely to be, that is quite well,' answered Rachel.
5683_32879_000029_000001	I meant to speak to him, and end all between us, and I would now write. But there is no address to his letters.
5683_32879_000040_000000	Dork is here changed. Have I lost your love For asking so poor a kindness?
5683_32879_000042_000002	I have very few to love me now, and I thought you might love me as I'd begun to love you.
5683_32879_000043_000000	And she threw her arms around her cousin's neck and brave Rachel at last burst into tears.
5683_32879_000046_000002	Thank you, from my heart, for your love. You will never know, perhaps, how much of
672_122797_000002_000002	Wark benicel furer! But this was what the tree could not bear to hear.
6829_68769_000005_000004	So this boy was doubly foolish in ruining himself to get $60 to pay an unjust demand.
6829_68769_000006_000000	He was soft-hearted and impetuous, said Beth, and being in love, he didn't stop to count the cost.
6829_68769_000012_000001	He was a round-faced, respectable-appearing fellow, but his mood was distinctly unsociable.
6829_68769_000030_000000	Then he deliberately locked Kenneth and Beth in with the forger and retreated along the passage.
6829_68769_000036_000001	He was of sturdy, athletic build and dressed neatly in his suit, that was of coarse material but well brushed and cared for.
6829_68769_000051_000002	Then Rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around and wait upon her in the place which rack and ruin.
6829_68769_000053_000000	Lucy could have looked after her mother," said young Bates, but old Will was stubborn and wouldn't let her.
6829_68769_000063_000001	It won't be much, but I am grateful to find a fandom guilty, you know, and there's no one to blame but myself.
6829_68769_000073_000000	They've been bothered already over your election campaign," resumed the manager, arranging his papers in a bored manner.
6829_68769_000073_000002	You may as well understand, sir, that I stand for the Democratic candidate and have no sympathy with your side.
6829_68769_000074_000000	That doesn't interest me, especially, sir," answered Kenneth, smiling.
6829_68769_000086_000001	I'll pay twice $60 for the delivery to me of the forged check and the withdrawal of the prosecution.
6829_68769_000091_000001	Give me a check for $150 and I'll turn over to you the forged check and quash for the proceedings.
6829_68769_000100_000001	and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of $150.
6829_68771_000010_000007	his trading votes, which was often none, was considered by the politicians quite legitimate.
6829_68771_000010_000008	The only thing necessary was to fix Seth Reynolds, and this Hopkins arranged personally.
6829_68771_000012_000001	Every scheme known to politicians must be worked, and none knew the intricate game better than Hopkins.
6829_68771_000012_000002	This was why he held several long conferences with his friend Marshall, the manager at the mail.
6829_68771_000012_000003	And this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman, the buddy.
6829_68771_000015_000000	Patsy and Beth supported their cousin loyally and assisted in the preparations.
6829_68771_000018_000000	The gardens and grounds were gaily decorated with Taiwanese and Japanese lanterns, streamers, and Forbes banners.
6829_68771_000035_000000	For the first time, the maid seemed a little confused, and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
6829_68771_000039_000000	She sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap, rocked slowly back and forth.
6829_68771_000044_000003	Her manner was neither independent nor assertive, but rather one of well-bred composure and calm reliance.
6829_68771_000044_000004	Beth felt that she was intruding, and knew that she ought to go, yet some fascination held her to the spot.
6829_68771_000044_000006	However her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness, these hands told a different story.
6829_68771_000046_000001	She rose quickly to her feet, with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath.
6930_76324_000005_000001	I thought we were stumped again when I first saw thy picture, but it's been of some use after all.
6930_76324_000026_000003	I just touched something soft. In the instant, Joyce was either side of the candle.
6930_81414_000014_000003	It did not bake it, nor indeed move at all. It was still at the hand of death.
7021_79730_000053_000000	The mistake to her stead meant that she was going to the doctors, and not to the hospital.
7021_79740_000011_000000	Then, turning to Jane, she asked in a somewhat all-cheat tone, has she been a good girl, Jane?
7021_79740_000020_000000	"'Nare,' said she, pointing to the playthings. See, all your playthings left out."
7021_79740_000020_000003	One would think that they might do so too. And that would make you a great deal of trouble.
7021_79740_000021_000000	So the children went to work with great alagvili and puputei things all away.
7021_85628_000002_000000	Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Anders who had a new cap.
7021_85628_000005_000000	The first person he met was a farm labourer walking alongside a load of peat and smacking at his horse.
7021_85628_000009_000000	Let's swap caps, he said, and I will give you my jet knife to boot.
7021_85628_000021_000001	For a wiker's knot, they must have bought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
7021_85628_000025_000000	Well, well, give it to me, said the princess, and I will give you a kiss.
7021_85628_000034_000001	He sat as before and held on to his red cap, which everybody was so anxious to get.
7021_85628_000035_000001	He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
7127_75946_000002_000001	As for the ballet itself, every person knew the part he had to take in it and how to perform it.
7127_75946_000016_000000	Well, sire, the colored lamps, the fireworks, the musicians, and the cooks have swallowed up four millions in eight days.
7127_75946_000033_000000	I reserve your services for a better occasion and believe me, they will only be the better appreciated.
7127_75946_000040_000004	The music, haught boys, flutes and vials, was delightfully descriptive of rural delights.
7127_75946_000040_000006	He was dressed in a tunic of flowers which set off his graceful and well-formed figure to advantage.
7127_75946_000041_000001	The applause continued so long that the Count had ample leisure to join the king.
7127_75946_000045_000000	Far from it, sire. Your majesty, having given no directions about it, the musicians have retained it.
7127_75946_000058_000000	Every word fell distinctly in perfect harmony and eloquence upon Llewod the Fourteen Seers.
7127_75947_000006_000000	The king remained for a moment to enjoy a triumph as complete as it could possibly be.
7127_75947_000006_000009	A geish observing that she was alone, near a thicket constructed of painted cloth approached her.
7127_75947_000007_000000	Upon this Madame dined to turn her eyes languishingly towards the compte observing.
7127_75947_000010_000000	Yes, the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own.
7127_75947_000034_000000	They'll turn out to be I believe, giants. You research it handily, then.
7127_75947_000071_000000	Yes, but if she should have understood, and understood too well, she may talk.
7127_75947_000082_000005	The three young girls on their side reached the outskirts of the park every path of which they well knew.
7176_88083_000002_000004	Moreover, he was not in the situation or his surroundings which one is wont to associate with ducks.
7176_88083_000004_000000	The duck was a handsome male with the red breast of the Ganser family and the absorbing interest of his life was fish.
7176_88083_000004_000002	Here, when North's fortress fell into the Altensis, was a resort exactly to his liking.
7176_88083_000006_000003	But here he was a terrible disa-durable as compared with the owls, hawks, and indigos.
7176_88083_000006_000005	Had he taken such a prize, he could not have profited by it, having no means of tearing to pieces
7176_88083_000010_000002	For all its appalling speed, the sound of its light was nothing more than a strong pulsatingness.
7176_88083_000011_000005	It was enough, however, and the unhappy teal was hurled birthward, flapping through the tips of the branches.
7176_88083_000012_000000	As it chanced, however, the victim came down with a thud almost beneath the wistered nose of the wildcat.
7176_88083_000012_000005	The cat growled softly, picked up the prize in her jaws, and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
7176_88083_000013_000002	Happily for him, he on his part caught sight of the hawk and dropped like lead into the torrent.
7176_88083_000015_000003	With only head on wings above the mad smother, he flat onward frantically, beating down the foam about him.
7176_88083_000017_000005	Where the way is farthest instant sank they came closer, but not caught within grasping reach.
7176_88083_000017_000006	The marauder from the upper arrow is waiting till his quarry should reach less turbulent waters.
7176_88083_000018_000000	A few yards further on the toad fell seething over a long ledge into a pool of brief quiet
7176_88083_000018_000003	The Wiley Drake had plunged with the plunge of the fall itself and was now darting onward a safe death.
7176_88083_000022_000000	Just as he made his cast he saw the fleeing Drake and the pursuing Hawk come round the bend.
7176_88083_000023_000004	The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexpressible to him and appalling.
7176_88083_000024_000003	He dived and caught it, came to the surface and swallowed it much refreshed. He looked about him.
7176_92135_000004_000002	It was an unsatisfying life, and when rash acquaintances asked him what he did, he used to say that he was for the bar.
7176_92135_000006_000006	Can you give me a few hints? Suppose you spoke to me like this. Then I could do something for you.
7176_92135_000012_000003	Of course, a really good actor can often give a clue to the feelings of a character simply by facial expression.
7176_92135_000018_000000	and so on, till you get to the end, when the way and feel you might say, oh, yes, or something non-committal of that sort.
7176_92135_000018_000002	What you want is to make it clear that you are conveying Hamlet's thoughts to neither
7176_92135_000055_000000	The answer to this will depend upon the length of the play. For polar lengths depends the hour at which the curtain rises.
7176_92135_000056_000002	Then the curtain rises, and it is apparent that we are assisting at an at-home of considerable splendor.
7176_92135_000070_000002	Let your actors have tea by all means, but see that it is a properly histrionic tea.
7729_102255_000010_000014	They were not only well armed and supplied, but wrought up to the highest pitch of partisan excitement.
7729_102255_000012_000001	The people of Lawrence, without any great difficulty, obtained daily information concerning the hostile camps.
7729_102255_000012_000007	with the advantage of its defensive position. Lawrence was as strong as the sheriff's mob.
7729_102255_000012_000011	The Missouri Backwoods men manifested an almost incredible interest in this wonderful gun.
7729_102255_000016_000002	the firm defensive attitude of the people of Lawrence had produced its effect.
7729_102255_000016_000003	The leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town.
7729_102255_000016_000006	In the Missouri camp, while the leaders became alarmed, the men grew insubordinate.
7729_102255_000016_000008	The forces of the Leckomtom camp fully understand the plot, and will fight under the same banner.
7729_102255_000018_000006	Neither party is willing to yield honestly, Nor ready to fight manfully.
7729_102255_000021_000000	The truce patched up by this Lawrence Treaty was of comparatively short duration.
7729_102255_000025_000003	The people of Lawrence denounced the deed, but the sheriff warded up the score for future revenge.
7729_102255_000028_000004	Their distinctive characters, however, display a way broad on the unfailing difference.
7729_102255_000028_000008	their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities.
7729_102255_000034_000005	End days will consume the indies negotiations, but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield.
7729_102255_000035_000001	He continued his pertenued search, and to give color to his errand, made two arrests.
7729_102255_000035_000006	The military force, partly rabble, partly organized, had meanwhile moved into the town.
7729_102255_000036_000005	The inmates being removed, at the appointed hour, a few cannonballs were fired through the stone walls.
8224_274384_000005_000001	he was the kicking of the lutenti to the behaviour of their preachers on whom all depend.
8224_274384_000006_000000	Why dost thou, tyrant, boast thyself thy wicked deeds to praise?
8224_274384_000017_000002	What were they little worse than what were insisted on before the Battle of Naseby?
8230_279154_000002_000000	Memory, which we are to consider today, introduces us to knowledge in one of its forms.
8230_279154_000004_000006	How, then, are we to find any way of comparing the present image and the past sensation?
8230_279154_000004_000009	In this event, before we start the submission,
8230_279154_000007_000000	I am not suggesting that the non-existence of the past should be entertained as a serious hypothesis.
8230_279154_000011_000001	It might be suggested that vagueness is the required characteristic, but I do not think this is the case.
8230_279154_000011_000003	In such a case, we distress our image in spite of its being unusually clear.
8230_279154_000011_000005	Some rimajoris, like some sensations, feel very familiar, while others feel strange.
8230_279154_000017_000002	but the rejection of the subject renders some more complicated theory necessary.
8230_279154_000017_000003	Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered.
8230_279154_000018_000000	Some points may be taken as fixed, and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
8230_279154_000018_000005	Nevertheless, in spite of the risk of error, precedentive is the goal at which we must aim.

8230_279154_000022_000007	When we have once described the want, the words we have used easily become habitual.
8230_279154_000024_000000	The sort of memory with which we are here concerned. It is the sort which is a form of knowledge.
8230_279154_000027_000002	We recognize our friend Jones, we know cats and dogs when we see them, and so on.
8455_210777_000003_000004	And what hope had there been? What reasonable expectation that the system should have been allowed fair play?
8455_210777_000012_000002	I must I know mean so in such company as was now present the strong feeling which pervaded my own mind.
8455_210777_000014_000000	This was a pretty little speech enough, and received the eager compliments of the officers of the John Bright.
8455_210777_000015_000000	Jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to Ava and was now reduced to silence by his praises.
8455_210777_000022_000005	When the President of the Republic has his health drunk, I can see his duty to do so.
8455_210777_000034_000000	and all in opposition to the wishes, as I understand, of a large proportion of your fellow citizens.
8455_210777_000040_000000	And you are, I'm aware, sufficiently popular with the people here to enable you to do so.
8455_210777_000049_000001	I was to be taken away and carried to England or elsewhere, or drowned upon a bridge, it mattered not which.
8455_210777_000050_000001	Now, at the close of the 20th century, could oppression be carried to such a height as this?
8455_210777_000053_000000	Lieutenant Krostreis has sealed orders and is practically acquainted with the mechanism of the gun.
8455_210777_000061_000004	The country has since undoubtedly prospered and in a material point of view has given us no grounds for regret.
8455_210777_000079_000002	All this I could hardly explain to him, as I should best be giving to him the strongest evidence against my own philosophy.
8463_287645_000003_000002	nor was he all muscled by a great deal. He was well balanced as to motherhood and shrewdness.
8463_287645_000024_000000	When Asworth first prompted him to seek his freedom, he replied, O my senses,
8463_287645_000030_000001	He had it everything like slavery and as young as he was he had already made five attempts to escape
8463_294825_000018_000001	The Poles were quashed with the violence that appalled not only Rind, but all Europe.
8463_294825_000030_000000	Because as that time cover story suggests, you still haven't caved up with her.

8463_294828_000014_000000	Even so, I just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and badly, needing a rest.
8463_294828_000021_000000	The lad was 30 years old and his age to that of his employer was as 15 is to 20
8463_294828_000022_000001	He was a fanatic on formality, and he only addressed me and the third person to the point where it got tiresome.

8463_294828_000047_000001	I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France.
8463_294828_000067_000000	leaking until it reached the waters of the Hudson River at the tip of the Long Peninsula that forms New York City.
8555_284447_000008_000000	So ho, roared the monarch, Do thought you could define the earth, Clyde, did you?
8555_284447_000010_000001	My guard did not to be trusted and I don't mean to let you get out of my sight again until you are patched.
8555_284447_000012_000001	No one could see her. So no one, not even Captain Bill, knew she was there.
8555_284447_000013_000001	Invisible Trunk followed soberly after them, still wondering what she could do to save her friend.
8555_284447_000018_000000	The room of the great knife was high and big, and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon.
8555_284447_000018_000003	Therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her
8555_284447_000020_000002	These plumes waved gracefully in the air with every mincing step the princesses took.
8555_284447_000033_000003	Go and capture the first living creature you see and bring him here to be patched to Captain Bill.
