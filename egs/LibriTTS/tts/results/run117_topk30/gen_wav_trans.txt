1272_128104_000001_000000	A Jollyard Critic.
1272_128104_000003_000000	There is a healthy bank holiday atmosphere about this book, which is extremely pleasant.
1272_128104_000003_000001	Mr. Coulter is entirely free from affectation of any kind.
1272_128104_000003_000002	He relects to art with the recklessness of the tourist and describes its beauties with the enthusiasm of the auctioneer.
1272_128104_000003_000003	To many, no doubt, he will seem to be somewhat blatant and bumptious, but we prefer to regard him as being simply British.
1272_128104_000003_000005	After listening so long to the Dhan Kihodi of art, to listen once to Sanghva Panca is both salutary and refreshing.
1272_128104_000005_000000	About artists and their work, Mr. Quilter has of course a great deal to say.
1272_128104_000005_000001	Sculpture, he regards, is painting's poor relation, so, with the exception of a jaunty allusion to the rough modelling of tenegra, figurines, he hardly refers at all to the plastic arts. But on painters he writes with much
1272_128104_000005_000006	That there is a difference between color and color and colors that an artist, be he portrait painter or dramatist, always reveals himself in his manner, are ideas that can hardly be said to occur to him. But Mr. Quilter really does his best and bravely faces every difficulty in modern
1272_128104_000005_000007	painting. He tells us it is ours. He taught us anymore facts.
1272_128104_000005_000008	Portrait painting is a bad pursuit for an emotional artist as it destroys his personality and his sympathy, however. Even for the emotional artist, there is hope as a portrait can be converted into a picture by adding to the likeness of the sitter some dramatic
1272_128104_000005_000009	As for etchings, they are of two kinds, British and foreign.
1272_128104_000005_000013	And then the picture he draws of the ideal home where everything, the logos, hallowed by domestic memories, and where beauty appeals not to the heartless eye, but the family affections. Babies cheer there, and the mothers
1272_128104_000005_000014	It is really impossible not to be touched by so charming a description.
1272_128104_000006_000003	Far from it.
1272_128104_000006_000008	On the whole, the book will not do.
1272_128104_000006_000009	We fully admit that it is extremely amusing, and Doudna's seculture is quite earnest in his endeavours to elevate art to the dignity of manual labour, but the extraordinary vulgarity of the style alone will always be sufficient to prevent these sententious artists

1272_135031_000002_000000	King Talib
1272_135031_000005_000000	Don't worry, reply quacks.
1272_135031_000007_000001	Next instant Shaggy was himself again, and Quark said to him grumblingly,
1272_135031_000008_000000	Please get off my left toe, shaggy man. And be more particular where you step.
1272_135031_000026_000002	Quark did not have much to say until the conversation was ended, but then he turned to Coleco and asked,
1272_135031_000028_000000	Me?" stammered the Chamberlain, greatly surprised by the question. Well, I couldn't be a worse king, I'm sure.
1272_135031_000030_000000	Of course, said Kelly Foe.
1272_135031_000032_000000	Hooray! cried Betsy unglad of that.
1272_135031_000035_000000	The ugly one?
1272_135031_000035_000001	Very willingly, replies Kaliso.
1272_135031_000036_000002	But is my dear brother well he had anxiously
1272_135031_000038_000000	I hope he doesn't work too hard said Shaggy.
1272_135031_000039_000000	He doesn't work at all.
1272_135031_000041_000000	Not exactly Return to the Rico.
1272_135031_000043_000000	in the metal forest.
1272_135031_000044_000000	Where is that?
1272_135031_000045_000002	All the trees are gold, and silver, and the ground is strewn with precious stones. So it is a sort of treasury.
1272_135031_000047_000000	Calico hesitated.
1272_135031_000051_000000	Do you suppose Rigedo destroyed them?
1272_135031_000052_000000	Oh, I'm quite sure he didn't.
1272_135031_000052_000001	They fell into the big pit in the passage, and we put the cover on to keep them there. But when the executioners went to look for them, they had all disappeared from the pit, and we could find no trace of them.
1272_135031_000053_000000	That's funny, remarked Betsy thoughtfully.
1272_135031_000053_000002	But to disappear like that seems like magic now, doesn't it?
1272_135031_000054_000000	They agreed that it did, but no one could explain the mystery.
1272_135031_000055_000000	However, said Shaggy, they are gone, that is certain, so we cannot help them or be helped by them.
1272_135031_000058_000000	But she laughed, and Shaggy seemed rather hurt, but Polichrome relieved his embarrassment by saying softly, One can be ugly in looks, but lovely in disposition.
1272_135031_000060_000000	True, agreed Teleco.
1272_135031_000060_000001	So I think I will assemble the chief gnomes of my kingdom in this throne room and tell them that I am their new king. Then I can ask them to assist us in searching for the secret passages.
1272_135031_000063_000000	Of course not, said he, jumping up from the throne where he had seated himself.
1272_141231_000002_000000	for my mother and father.
1272_141231_000006_000000	Stephen Crane
1272_141231_000007_000003	And when he attacked, it was always there to beat him aside.
1272_141231_000008_000001	He reacted but his blade just met air.
1272_141231_000010_000000	One minute, a voice said, and the time buzzer sounded.
1272_141231_000011_000000	Brian had carefully conditioned the reflex in himself.
1272_141231_000011_000002	Buzzes were triggered his muscles into complete relaxation.
1272_141231_000011_000003	Only his heart and lungs work on at a strong measured rate.
1272_141231_000011_000004	His eyes closed and he was only distantly aware of his handlers catching him as he fell, carrying him to his bench while they massaged his limp body and cleansed the wound. All of his attention was turned inward.
1272_141231_000011_000006	The nagging memory of the previous night loomed up then, and he turned it over and over in his mind, examining it from all sides.
1272_141231_000012_000001	The contestants in the twenties needed undisturbed rest, therefore nights in the dormitories were as quiet as death.
1272_141231_000012_000003	But as soon as the scores began to mount and eliminations cut into their ranks, there was complete silence after dark.
1272_141231_000012_000004	Particularly so on this last night, when only two of the little cubicles were occupied. The thousands others standing with dark, empty doors.
1272_141231_000013_000001	Words were whispered but clear two voices, just outside the thin metal of his door.
1272_141231_000013_000002	Someone spoke his name.
1272_141231_000014_000001	Of course not.
1272_141231_000014_000002	Whoever said you could was making a big mistake and there is going to be trouble.
1272_141231_000015_000000	Don't talk an idiot.
1272_141231_000015_000001	The other voice snapped with a harsh urgency, clearly used to command
1272_141231_000015_000003	Now who's to stand aside?
1272_141231_000018_000001	He must have drawn his gun because the intruder said quickly, put that away.
1272_141231_000018_000002	You're being a fool.
1272_141231_000019_000000	Out was the single snarled word of the response.
1272_141231_000019_000001	There was silence then, and, still wondering, Brian was once more asleep.
1272_141231_000020_000000	10 seconds.
1272_141231_000021_000001	He was unhappily conscious of his total exhaustion.
1272_141231_000021_000002	The month of continuous mental and physical combat had taken its toll.
1272_141231_000021_000003	It would be hard to stay on his feet, much less summon the strength and skill to fight and win a touch.
1272_141231_000022_000000	How do we stand? he asked the handler who was kneading his aching muscles.
1272_141231_000023_000000	4 4
1272_141231_000023_000001	All you need is a touch to win.
1272_141231_000024_000000	That's all needs too. Brian grunted, opening his eyes to look at the weary length of the man at the other end of the long mat.
1272_141231_000024_000002	A red-haired mountain of a man with an apparently inexhaustible store of energy.
1272_141231_000024_000003	That was really all that counted now.
1272_141231_000024_000005	Just thrust and parry in victory to the stronger.
1272_141231_000026_000000	Every man who entered the 20s had his own training tricks, Brian had a few individual ones that had helped him so far.
1272_141231_000026_000003	He had a standing order with off-planet agents for arcade chess books. The older the better.
1272_141231_000026_000005	This was allowed.
1272_141231_000026_000007	So, hypnosis was an accepted tool.
1272_141231_000027_000001	Common as the phenomenon seemed to be in the textbooks it proved impossible to duplicate.
1272_141231_000027_000003	Berserkers and Gerumenttados continue to fight and kill, though carved by scores of mortal wounds.
1272_141231_000027_000005	Death seemed an inescapable part of this kind of strength. But there was another type that could easily be brought about in any deep trance hypnotic rigidity.
1272_141231_000027_000007	This is physically impossible unconscious.
1272_141231_000027_000008	Working with this clue, Brian had developed a self-hypnotic technique that allowed him to tap this reservoir of unknown strength, the source of second wind, the survival strength that made the difference between
1272_141231_000028_000002	Others had died before during the twenties, and death, during the last round, was in some ways easier than defeat.
1272_141231_000029_000002	He could feel with acute sensitivity here and see clearly when he opened his eyes.
1272_141231_000030_000000	With each passing second to power drew it the basic reserves of life, draining it from his body.
1272_141231_000031_000000	On the buzz of sound, Rudy pulled his foil from his second startled grasp and ran forward.
1272_141231_000031_000002	The force of his rush was so great that the guards on their weapons locked and their bodies crushed together.
1272_141231_000032_000001	He didn't attempt to attack, just let Brian wear himself out against the firm shield of his defense.
1272_141231_000033_000000	Brian saw something close to panic on his opponent's face when the man finally recognized his error.
1272_141231_000033_000001	Brian wasn't tiring.
