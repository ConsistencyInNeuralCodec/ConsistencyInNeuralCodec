1089_134686_000002_000001	After early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter of the brothels.
1089_134686_000007_000005	The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space.
1089_134686_000009_000003	The chaos in which is our door extinguished itself is a cold and different knowledge of himself.
1089_134686_000009_000008	What did it avail to pray, when he knew that his soul lusted after its end-destruction?
1089_134686_000015_000003	The bell rang, the master marked the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson, and went out.
1089_134686_000024_000002	If a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words the child baptized,
1089_134686_000026_000003	A gentle kick from the tall boy. In the bench behind her, it's Stephen to ask a difficult question.
1089_134686_000028_000004	Mass will be on Saturday morning at 9 o'clock in general, communion for the whole college.
1089_134686_000030_000000	A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the Rector's grim smile.
1089_134686_000030_000001	Stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fear like a withering flower.
1089_134686_000032_000006	He is said to have baptized as many as 10,000 Dardeladars in one month.
1089_134691_000004_000000	Death's mother was hostile to the idea, as he had read from her listless silence.
1089_134691_000006_000000	Whose feet of hearts and underneath the everlasting arms
1089_134691_000007_000000	The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused.
1089_134691_000013_000004	No, it was not their colors. It was the poise and balance of the period itself.
1089_134691_000015_000000	A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river was inbade.
1089_134691_000025_000002	Perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls.
1089_134691_000027_000000	The banter was not new to him, and now it flattered his mild proud sovereignty.
1089_134691_000039_000000	He started up nervously from the stone block for he could no longer quench the flame in his blood.
1089_134691_000042_000001	Emerald, and blackened russet, and olive it, Moved beneath the current, swaying and turning.
1089_134691_000042_000002	The water of the rivulet was dark within this drift and mirrored the high drifting clouds.
1089_134691_000045_000004	Her slate blue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her.
1089_134691_000047_000000	Heavenly God cried Stephen's soul in an outburst of profane joy.
1089_134691_000049_000002	to live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life.
1089_134691_000054_000000	Evening had fallen when he woke, and the sand and air-grasses of his bed glowed no longer
1188_133604_000024_000000	in this vignette. Copied from Turner. You have the two principles brought out perfectly. Out perfectly.

121_127105_000007_000003	This I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait.
121_127105_000012_000000	She seemed to say it was not so simple as that. To be really at a loss how to qualify it.
121_127105_000014_000000	shoot. He took no notice of her. He looked at me as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of.
121_127105_000016_000000	turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an instant,
121_127105_000018_000001	I took that here, he tapped his heart, I've never lost it.
121_127105_000020_000004	But if he put the inference that without a smile, it was smiled, it was also without irritation.
121_127105_000020_000009	So yes, don't grin. I liked her extremely and I'm glad to this day to think she liked me too.
121_127105_000033_000000	The story won't tell," said Douglas, not in any literal vulgar way.
121_127105_000044_000003	The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations, and that his own affairs took up all his time.
1284_1180_000007_000000	At the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the Munchkins from the country of the Gillikins. The path divided.
1284_1180_000020_000000	I never knew I was called the unlucky, said Oyo, soberly, but it is really a good name for me.
1284_1180_000023_000000	I do not know how, but you must keep the matter in mind, and perhaps the chance will come to you," she replied.
1284_1180_000027_000000	We are traveling," replied Ojo, and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves
1284_1180_000045_000002	What is that? Oh, you asked, for this seemed even more strange and unusual than a glass cat.
1284_1180_000053_000001	I will show you what a good job I did. And she went to a tall cupboard and through a tall cupboard and through oars.
1284_1181_000027_000000	This powder must not be used before tomorrow morning, but I think it is now cool enough to be bottled.
1284_1181_000028_000001	Very carefully he placed the Powder of Life in the gold bottle and then locked it up in a drawer of his cabinet.
1320_122612_000002_000000	If you find a man there, he shall die, Of fleas' death merry wives of Windsor.
1320_122612_000006_000004	At last the scouts spoke in English and at once explained the embarrassment of their situation.
1320_122612_000020_000001	A circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn, and each of the party took a segment for his portion.
1320_122612_000021_000000	Such cunning is not without its deviltry, exclaimed Tokai when he met the disappointed looks of his assistants.
1320_122612_000029_000000	The whole party now proceeded, following the course of the rail, keeping anxious eyes and the regular impressions.
1320_122612_000033_000000	Softly, softly, softly. We know our path, but it is good to examine the formation of things.
1320_122612_000037_000001	See, the heel has hardly touched the ground, And there the dark hair has made a little jump From root to root, to roots to root.
1320_122612_000037_000002	No, no, my knowledge for it and neither of them was nigh fainting hereyway.
1320_122612_000051_000001	Do you keep him under your rifle while I creep in behind through the bush and take him alive?
1320_122612_000056_000003	Having reached within a few yards of the ladder, he arose to his feet, silently and slowly, and slowly and slowly.
1320_122617_000043_000001	So, on case you had better take the lead, While I would put on the skin again, And trust the cunning of the want of speed.
1580_141083_000006_000000	My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street.
1580_141083_000006_000001	without his scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely antediluvianists. He was an uncomfortable man.
1580_141083_000008_000004	I had, however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I left the proof upon my desk.
1580_141083_000009_000002	For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there bucket. I found that it was all right.
1580_141083_000012_000000	The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third where you left it, said he.
1580_141083_000015_000000	For an instant I imagined that banister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers.
1580_141083_000015_000002	The alternative was that some one passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers.
1580_141083_000016_000006	Avedelli the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it.
1580_141083_000017_000000	Excellent, said Holmes, who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.
1580_141083_000018_000004	Not on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.
1580_141083_000047_000007	He carried them over to the window-table, because see if you came across the courtyard and so could effect an escape.
1580_141083_000056_000006	I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface.
1580_141083_000061_000001	As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs.
1580_141083_000063_000000	It was a small pyramid of black putty-like stuff, exactly like the one upon the table of the study.
1580_141083_000066_000002	What could he do? He caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.
1580_141083_000070_000000	Ladder's pond, lead framework, three separate windows, one swinging on hinge, and large enough to man.
1580_141083_000081_000003	His father was the notorious Sir Jabba Skillcrest, who ruined himself on the turf.
1580_141084_000009_000001	A tall, flaxen young fellow opened it, And made us welcome when he understood our errand.
1580_141084_000009_000007	The outer door would not open to Ornok, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it.
1580_141084_000029_000001	All were agreed that one could be ordered but that it was not a usual size of pencil, and that it was seldom kept in stock.
1580_141084_000029_000002	My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation.
1580_141084_000031_000000	Holmes made no further allusion to the matter of the day, though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner.
1580_141084_000044_000000	The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers.
1580_141084_000069_000001	He was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe and agile, with a springy step and a pleasant open face.
1580_141084_000071_000000	The unfortunate young man staggered back and cast a look full of horror and reproach at Bannister.
1580_141084_000075_000000	Come, come, said Holmes, kindly it is human to err, and at least do of being a callous criminal.
1580_141084_000077_000003	I was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see as he passed what papers were on the central table.
1580_141084_000077_000004	I am six feet high and I could do it with an effort no one less than that would have a chance.
1580_141084_000078_000001	On the center table I could make nothing until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long-distance jumper.
1580_141084_000079_000002	As he passed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these proofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were.
1580_141084_000079_000005	It was not a dangerous exploit, for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question.
1580_141084_000082_000007	You observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side. It deepens in the direction of the bedroom door.
1995_1826_000016_000011	She wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms.
1995_1826_000022_000001	Ms. Taylor did not know much about cotton, but at least one more remark seemed called for.
1995_1826_000056_000000	She started thinking of cotton, but at once she pulled herself back to the other aspect.
1995_1836_000003_000002	At last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured fact, and he was slated for the Senate.
1995_1836_000019_000000	But Cresswell added significantly, capacity differs enormously between races.
1995_1837_000010_000005	To her, all things meant something, nothing merely happened.
1995_1837_000011_000002	Perhaps if the water had but drained from the cotton, it was so strong and tall. But Pee Shaw
1995_1837_000012_000003	The raindrops were still dripping and gleaming from the trees, flashing back the heavy yellow sunlight.
1995_1837_000019_000001	The cotton crop was short and poor because of the great rain, but the sun had saved the best and the price had soared.
1995_1837_000021_000002	The sun, the swamp, then finding all well, she closed her eyes and slept.
1995_1837_000026_000002	He came down to her, slowly, with fixed, hungry eyes, dreading his way amid the fleece.
2300_131720_000003_000001	It went into service August 15, 1882, about three weeks before the Pearl Street Station.
2300_131720_000004_000006	Why are we erect and stationed at the falls? It is a great economy to get it up to this city.
2300_131720_000004_000012	Burbank and his tribe represent in the vegetable world Addison in the mechanical.
2300_131720_000006_000001	Every department of mechanics was stimulated and been extraordinary degree.
2300_131720_000008_000007	I requested him to make a sheet brass oil cup and solder it to the base I had.
2300_131720_000008_000009	I then had a standard made to hold another oil cup, so as to see and regulate the drop feed.
2300_131720_000016_000012	They found an engine somewhat loose in the bearings, and their followed remarks, which would not look well in print.
2300_131720_000019_000001	At this time and long after, all arc lighting was done on a flat rate basis.
2300_131720_000020_000008	Hence the Edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities.
2300_131720_000023_000003	The meter continued in general service during 1899 and probably up to the close of the century.
2300_131720_000025_000007	Vade from this lamp would prevent the liquid from freezing so that the meter could go on doing its duty.
2300_131720_000026_000000	After the station had been running several months and was technically a success, we began to look after the financial part.
2300_131720_000026_000007	They said they were sorry, that is, Wall Street sorry, and refused to pay it.
2300_131720_000032_000005	The investors in the enterprise were ready and anxious to meet the extra cost of putting the wires underground.
2300_131720_000034_000005	One evening there came a sudden flash of fire and a spluttering, sizzling noise.
2300_131720_000039_000007	We had two wire underground feeders sent without any plans or specifications for their installation.
2300_131720_000040_000005	Among the exhibits of that exposition was the Edison System of Incandescent Lighting.
2300_131720_000042_000002	The machinery was taken up in pieces on the backs of mules from the foot of the mountain.
237_126133_000002_000004	It got to be noticed fondly in one, and all redoubled their exertions to make everything twice as pleasant as ever.
237_126133_000015_000001	Somehow, of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest, this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer.
237_126133_000021_000000	At this the bundle opened suddenly, and out popped Francie.
237_126133_000024_000000	Aren't you glad I've come, Polly?" asked Francy with her little face close to Polly's own.
237_126133_000028_000000	Is her name Francie? Put in dick and willing to be left out and not thinking of anything else to ask?
237_126133_000029_000000	Boys, whispered their mother, warningly, she can't answer you, just look at her face.
237_126133_000034_000000	I know gasped Polly controlling her sobs. I won't only I can't thank you
237_126133_000043_000000	So you must. Kajaspo enchanted his success in amusing. I'll go with you."
237_126133_000046_000000	"'O Francie!' cried Polly, turning around at the last words, "'How could you?'
237_134493_000002_000002	Could he rise from beneath it, he would not know the country under which he has been asleep.
237_134493_000002_000003	The shaggy coat of the prairie which they lifted to make him a bed has vanished forever.
237_134493_000004_000003	The air and the earth are curiously mitted and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other.
237_134493_000007_000000	Would he have been knowing the better part of an hour? He heard the rattle of a light cart on the road behind him.
237_134493_000007_000001	Supposing that it was his sister coming back from one of her farms, he kept on with his work.
237_134493_000011_000000	Lots of the bohemian boys at the university are," said Emil, taking up his scythe again.
237_134493_000013_000001	Oh, there's no denying you're a spunk, you Chex. He called back over his shoulder.
237_134493_000017_000001	Oh, there's a good boy. She turned her head to him with a quick, bright smile.
237_134493_000021_000001	There were so many sheds and outbuildings grouped about it, but the place looked not unlike a tiny village.
237_134493_000021_000002	A stranger approaching it could not help noticing the beauty and fruitfulness of the outlying fields.
237_134493_000021_000003	There was something individual about the great farmer most unusual trimness and care for detail.
237_134493_000022_000001	One room is paper carpeted over furnished. The next is almost bare.
237_134500_000001_000002	One of the ghouls was getting a divorce and Frank took it as a personal affront.
237_134500_000001_000004	Frank read English slowly, and the more he read about this divorce case, the angrier.
237_134500_000003_000004	Frank and Lou Bergson had very similar ideas and they were two of the political agitators of the county.
237_134500_000014_000002	I'm a good Gethlick, but I think I could get along with caring for trees if I hadn't anything else
237_134500_000015_000000	"'That's a poor saying,' said Emile, stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass.
237_134500_000016_000002	I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way. They have to live than other things do.
237_134500_000022_000000	Oh, you know what I mean. Mary tossed her head impatiently, does she really care about him?
237_134500_000023_000000	Ghoul laughed and thrust his hands into his trousers' pockets.
237_134500_000031_000000	And there are so many, many things that echoed her tone sarcastically.
237_134500_000032_000001	"'I wish you weren't so restless, and didn't get so worked up over things,' she said sadly.
237_134500_000036_000003	and, anyhow—there's nothing to understand—she struck the ground with her little foot fiercely.
237_134500_000036_000005	It will go away, and things will be just as they used to I wish you were a Catholic.
260_123286_000005_000001	He examines the horizon all round with his glass and folds his arms with the air of an injured man.
260_123286_000007_000000	You seem anxious." My uncle, I said, seeing him continually with his glass to his eye.
260_123286_000013_000000	I then remembered that the professor before starting had estimated the length of this underground sea at 30 leagues.
260_123286_000020_000000	I take this as my answer and I leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience.
260_123286_000021_000005	I was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric light should grow dim or fail altogether.
260_123286_000031_000003	They possessed a perfect organization, gigantic proportions, prodigious strength.
260_123286_000033_000003	Yet the deep marks of conical teeth, Upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.
260_123286_000034_000003	What a very bad notion that was of his I thought to myself to take soundings just here
260_123286_000038_000001	The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again a distance of 20 cathathoms.
260_123286_000045_000001	We stood amazed. Thunder struck at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters.
260_123286_000047_000001	The reptiles rose, they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains.
260_123286_000057_000001	To monsters only we're creating all this commotion and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world. It's a primitive world.
260_123288_000004_000001	The atmosphere is charged with vapors, pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters.
260_123288_000006_000000	In the distance the clouds resemble great bales of cotton piled up in picturesque disorder.
260_123288_000023_000005	My eyes fail under the dazzling light. My ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder.
260_123288_000023_000006	I must be bound to the mast, which bows like a reed before the mighty strength of this storm.
260_123288_000040_000000	The suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air. It enters the throat. It fills the lungs.
260_123288_000045_000004	We have been carried under England, under the Channel under France, perhaps under the whole of Europe.
260_123440_000010_000002	And yesterday things went on just as usual I wonder if I've been changed in the night
260_123440_000018_000002	That will be a queer thing to be sure. However, everything is queer today.
260_123440_000023_000001	And yet I wish I could show you our cat dino. I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
260_123440_000024_000002	Our family always hated cats, nasty, low, vulgar things.
2830_3979_000018_000000	The Reformer had lectured on this epistle of St. Paul's in 1519 and again in 1523.
2830_3979_000018_000002	In his table talks the saying is recorded, the epistle to the Galatians is my epistle.
2830_3979_000018_000006	The lectures which are preserved in the works herewith submitted to the American public were delivered in 1531.
2830_3979_000023_000000	Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill to men.
2830_3980_000017_000001	Do you suppose that God, for the sake of a few Lutheran heretics, would disown his entire church?
2830_3980_000018_000000	Against these boasting false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry.
2830_3980_000018_000002	He reminds them of the time when he opposed Peter to his face and reproved the chief of the apostles.
2830_3980_000021_000000	Every minister should make much of his calling and impress upon others the fact that he has been delegated by God to preach the gospel.
2830_3980_000022_000002	Paul exalts his ministry out of the desire to make known the name, the grace and the mercy of God.
2961_961_000008_000000	Socrates. Excellent. Time is, I like your manner of approaching the subject. Proceed.
2961_961_000011_000000	Are there many worlds or one only? That is the fourth question, one only.
2961_961_000020_000001	And God created them according to the patterns for species of them which existed in the divine original.
2961_961_000023_000007	And when external impressions enter in, they are really conquered, though they seem to conquer.
2961_961_000024_000002	This, however, is an after stage at present we are only concerned with the creation of the body and soul.
3570_5694_000007_000005	infamities induced by overindulgence are among some peoples freely recognized as manly attributes.
3570_5694_000007_000009	This Nvidia's traditional distinction has not lost its force even among the more advanced people of today.
3570_5694_000010_000001	He is no longer simply the successful, aggressive male, the man of strength, resource and intrepidity,
3570_5694_000011_000004	Costly entertainments, such as the potlatch or the bowl, are peculiarly adapted to serve this end.
3570_5694_000013_000001	This differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility.
3570_5694_000014_000019	In a heightened degree, therefore, the livery comes to be a badge of servitude, or rather servility.
3570_5695_000001_000001	It is a fact of common observance that in this lower middle class there is no pretence of leisure on the part of the head of the household.
3570_5695_000001_000003	But the middle-class wife still carries on the business of a carrier's leisure, for the good name of the household and its master.
3570_5695_000002_000000	The leisure rendered by the wife in such cases is, of course, not a simple manifestation of idle annoyance.
3570_5695_000004_000003	The observance of these standards in some degree of approximation becomes incumbent upon all classes lower in the scale.
3570_5695_000004_000010	No class of society, not even the most abjectly poor, forgoes all customary conspicuous consumption.
3570_5695_000004_000011	The last items of this category of consumption are not given up except under stress of the direst necessity.
3570_5695_000005_000001	Both are methods of demonstrating the possession of wealth, and the two are conventionally accepted as equivalents.
3570_5695_000005_000003	On grounds of expediency the preference may be given to the one or the other at different stages of the economic development.
3570_5695_000005_000004	The question is which of the two methods allows to effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect.
3570_5695_000008_000002	The result is that, in order to keep up a decent appearance, the former habitually lies hand to mouth to a greater extent than the latter,
3570_5695_000008_000005	But the provocation to this line of evidence, as well as its transient effectiveness, is more decided in the city.
3570_5695_000009_000004	Among the latter, everybody's especially everybody's pecuniary studies are known to everybody else.
3570_5695_000010_000005	At the same time, the wages in the trade are high enough to make movement from place to place relatively easy.
3570_5696_000004_000003	The instinct of workmanship is pleasant in all men and asserts itself even under very, very adverse circumstances.
3570_5696_000007_000004	A reconciliation between conflicting requirements is as effected by a resort to make-believe.
3575_170457_000010_000007	At first, like in 1837, I could not felt rebellious, but I knew it was wrong to feel so.
3575_170457_000015_000003	To every therefore is ambitious of distinction, and this way ought to be prepared for disappointment
3575_170457_000016_000000	But it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you consult your own happiness.
3575_170457_000024_000006	My father is a clergyman of limited, though competent, income, and I am the eldest of his children.
3575_170457_000024_000007	He expended quite as much in my education as he could afford in justice to the rest.
3575_170457_000024_000016	That letter is consecrated. No one shall ever see it but Papa and my brother and sisters.
3575_170457_000031_000002	Let me now request that if you ever should come to these lakes while I am living here, you will let me see you. While I'm living here, you will let me see you.
3575_170457_000044_000011	I am not good enough for you. I am not good enough for you and you must be kept from the temptation of too intimate society.
3575_170457_000046_000001	He refused at first to listen to the careful advice. It was repugnant to his liberal nature.
3575_170457_000046_000002	Fitness Brown, while persevered, urged economical motives, pressed on his love for his daughters.
3729_6852_000008_000001	She held her tongue.
3729_6852_000068_000004	Therefore it is not a paradox to say that the French would be wiser if they were less witty.
4077_13751_000019_000003	The tools were not wanting, as indeed they never have been, for murder and its kindred outrages.
4077_13754_000003_000005	He was unjustly charged with favouring secession, but favouring secession disproved.
4077_13754_000010_000002	But moralism died not. Every added pang of grief served but to unite the people.
4077_13754_000017_000001	The statement distinction between Bygamy and the Mormon and institution of plural marriage
4077_13754_000021_000002	And the world is learning to its manifest surprise that plural marriage and mononism are thus synonymous terms.
4077_13754_000023_000004	Its creed provides for the protection of all men and their rights of worship according to the dictates of conscience.
4446_2271_000001_000006	He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics.
4446_2271_000015_000004	Irene Burgoyne, one of her family, told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning.
4446_2271_000022_000010	I should torture myself. I couldn't help it. It was easy to forget actually to forget actually to forget.
4446_2271_000023_000011	I shouldn't wonder but they probably spoil her.
4446_2273_000001_000000	On Sunday afternoon, Alexander remembered Miss Burger, remembered Miss Bergen's invitation, and called at her apartment.
4446_2273_000001_000002	Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty and competent French servant who answered the door and brought in the tea.
4446_2273_000003_000002	For the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled, and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure.
4446_2273_000003_000003	On Thursday afternoon, he caught short a committee meeting, groped into a Hansom, and drove to Bedford Square.
4446_2273_000014_000001	I can't tell you how glad I am to have you so pretty and comfortable here and to hear everyone saying such nice things about you.
4446_2273_000015_000003	He's that gifted, you know. The tea will drain and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get.
4446_2273_000018_000000	It was a tiny room hung all round with French prints, of which ran a shelf which ran a shelf full of China.
4446_2273_000035_000000	They were both remembering what the woman had said. When she took the money, God give you a happy love.
4446_2273_000035_000003	They went home sadly with the lilacs. Back to the Rue Saint-Jacques, walking very slowly, arm in arm.
4446_2273_000043_000002	Most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly Boy tried a master, but he used me just a
4446_2273_000045_000000	He'll distort it up from the stool and move restlessly toward the window. It's really too warm, and it's really too warm in this room to sing.
4446_2273_000048_000001	He stood a little between her and tried to steady himself as he sat it soft and misty
4446_2275_000001_000001	The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mercy, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
4446_2275_000002_000004	A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit. Gore was already beginning to grow dark outside.
4446_2275_000009_000001	She looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head pressed forward like a catapult in leash.
4446_2275_000016_000000	He rose and pushed a chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room, seeming to find it too small for him.
4446_2275_000018_000000	It hasn't always made you miserable has it her eyelids fell and her lips quivered. I
4446_2275_000023_000000	Can you use it, Della? And talk about it, Leigh.
4446_2275_000030_000000	Yes, I was happy, wasn't I? Yes, I was happy, wasn't I? She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. Weren't you happy then, at all?
4446_2275_000033_000000	yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes now now now now now now now now now now,
4446_2275_000038_000006	You want to tell me that you can only see me like this as old friends do or out in the world among people?
4446_2275_000040_000004	What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again. No matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg.
4446_2275_000046_000006	If I'd met you later. If I hadn't loved you so well, but that's all over, long ago.
4446_2275_000047_000001	I took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.
4507_16021_000022_000000	Now, when has horror ever excluded study?
4507_16021_000025_000005	There are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces, but slang
4507_16021_000028_000004	Does anyone think that are the hewery things to say than Machiavelli?
4507_16021_000030_000000	Man is not a circle with a single center. He is an ellipse with a double focus.
4507_16021_000031_000001	There it clothes itself in word masks, in metaphor rags.
4507_16021_000034_000001	It gnashes and whispers, completing the gloom with mystery.
4507_16021_000035_000007	Who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice?
4507_16021_000036_000007	There is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny.
4507_16021_000036_000009	As for the rest of mankind, stagnating night rests upon them.
4507_16021_000037_000001	In this world, evidently the vestibule of another, there are no fortunate.
4507_16021_000039_000000	However, he who says lie does not necessarily say joy.
4507_16021_000039_000003	To burn without ceasing to fly, therein lies the marvel of genius.
4970_29093_000017_000000	His pen, therefore, and whereas, and not as aforesaid, strayed off into other scribbling,
4970_29093_000020_000001	It seemed to him that the newspaper managers didn't want genius, but mere plotting and grubbing.
4970_29093_000028_000000	It was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was one morning walking down Broadway with Henry Brarley.
4970_29093_000029_000000	The two were intimate at that time. They had been classmates and saw a great deal of each other.
4970_29093_000044_000000	The night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends.
4970_29093_000044_000002	Happy Youth that is ready to pack its follies and start for Cathay on an hour's notice.
4970_29093_000049_000001	He knew his uncle would be glad to hear they had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.
4970_29093_000050_000006	He was unsuccessful, or if he never returned perhaps it would be as well.
4970_29095_000003_000006	Whatever she thought she was not idly using as one might see by the expression of her face.
4970_29095_000009_000000	And I said, Mother, I want to go away and get out of this dead level.
4970_29095_000015_000000	Rula's turn square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and not the slightest changing of tone, said,
4970_29095_000018_000002	and the lectures on the dissecting rooms has thee thought of the dissecting rooms.
4970_29095_000035_000000	That evening Ruth and her father sat late by the drawing-room fire, as they were quite apt to do at night.
4970_29095_000049_000000	I want to be something, to make myself something, to do something.
4970_29095_000049_000002	What one useful thing could I do for a living for the support of a mother and the children?
4970_29095_000051_000000	Somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything retorted the sharp little disputant.
4970_29095_000054_000000	Ruth did not reply directly. She complained that her mother didn't understand her.
4970_29095_000054_000001	But that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than Ruth understood herself.
4992_23283_000033_000000	My lord, Miss Milner's taste is now the depraved one. It is but two or five.
4992_23283_000043_000001	To relieve her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart, and said, Do you believe me?
4992_41797_000015_000002	always irritable cold, indifferent. He had grown rapidly more so as years went on.
4992_41797_000025_000005	She's older than I am, but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child.
4992_41797_000026_000000	Have you ever lifted a stone and seen the pale yellow, stunted shoots of grass under it?
4992_41806_000009_000000	Don't know. Most everything she says sounds like the Bible or Shakespeare to me.
4992_41806_000010_000001	Then Nancy handed Peter a loosely bound sheaf, saying, To light this fire I give you a torch.
4992_41806_000020_000001	Thou, who settest the solitarian families, bless the life that is sheltered here.
4992_41806_000025_000001	Reaching the dining table, he carefully placed the article in the center and removed the cloth.
4992_41806_000034_000004	Mother Carrie played the dear old common-meader tune, and the voices rang out in Whittier's hymn.
5105_28233_000014_000000	and threw a storm of shot, not one of which touched the prostrate officer the true past in safety.
5105_28240_000031_000000	I am not sure," said he, but what the tour of the Mediterranean will prove to be the tour of the world.
5105_28241_000003_000001	Her sea-going qualities were excellent, and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe.
5105_28241_000019_000004	but all the other coast towns had apparently been absorbed into the bowels of the earth.
5105_28241_000021_000000	Is it not impossible, he murmured aloud, that any city should disappear so completely
5105_28241_000024_000000	You must see, Lieutenant, I should think that we are not so near the coast of Algeria as you imagined.
5142_33396_000008_000000	This is my vow. I will sail to Norway and I will harry the coast and fill my boat with riches.
5142_33396_000010_000000	But others jumped to their feet with their mead horns in their hands, thirty men, one after another, raised their horns and said,
5142_33396_000039_000001	They set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it, and we sat and watched it boil while we joked.
5142_33396_000053_000000	Well, after we had been there for a long time, Hakan came in to the feast one night and said,
5142_36377_000008_000005	A little crack that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the separate room.
5142_36377_000010_000006	They pointedly drew back from Don Iago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table.
5142_36377_000014_000003	She changed color for a moment and looked at him with a pretty reluctant tenderness as she took her chair.
5142_36586_000011_000001	When an artery is tied, the lateral channels increase not only in diameter, but in the thickness and strength of their coats.
5142_36586_000011_000002	When one kidney ceases to act from disease, the other increases in size and double work.
5142_36600_000007_000007	The races differ also in constitution and acclimatization and liability to certain diseases.
5639_40744_000003_000001	Rodolfo was now impatient to get rid of La Caudilla and made up his mind to lay her in the street, insensible as she was,
5639_40744_000026_000006	If my wife brings me this, I will thank heaven for the gift, and make my parents happy in their old age.
5639_40744_000027_000002	Rudolfo thanked her, and supper being ready, they went to join the rest of the party at table.
5683_32865_000006_000000	The churchyard meter expired. There was nothing in a moment but his ordinary smile of recognition.
5683_32865_000016_000002	It is such a darling little thing, and look, now is not it now. Is not it magnificent?
5683_32865_000021_000001	I see to be sure really, Walder. It is your taste, Infinite. I see it! Pitsies!
5683_32865_000022_000000	I'm glad you like it," says Wilder chuckling beaming minutely on it over his shoulder.
5683_32865_000028_000000	Wilder was laughing rather readily with the upper part of his face very surly.
5683_32865_000030_000000	Whereupon Lake laughed, still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.
5683_32865_000034_000001	It can't be for money, or balls, or play, And he has no honest business anywhere.
5683_32865_000038_000002	I took a dislike to him. I took a dislike long ago, and that never happened, but I was right.
5683_32865_000045_000000	I believe Charlie, he recommends suddenly, there is not such an unnatural family on record as ours, is there?
5683_32866_000016_000002	She was so unreserved. It seemed, and yet, in this directness there is something almost contemptuous.
5683_32866_000028_000000	"'It is very happy, for her at least they are not,' said Rachel, and a long silence ensued.
5683_32866_000039_000005	Whenever you meditate, he probably anticipates that you know best and you will find him prepared.
5683_32866_000039_000007	You were always the same close, dark, and crooked, and wise in your own conceit.
5683_32866_000047_000008	The somber old trees, like gigantic hurst-plumes, Black and awful.
5683_32879_000014_000002	You have been more all than I thought darling and you are still far from quite recovered
5683_32879_000015_000000	Rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilated eyes struck her with a painful surprise.
5683_32879_000016_000000	"'I shall soon be as well as I am ever likely to be, that is quite well,' answered Rachel.
5683_32879_000029_000001	I meant to speak to him, and end all between us. And I would now write, but there is no address to his letters.
5683_32879_000040_000000	Dorcas, you are changed have I lost your love? Asking so... Lord! Carstiel! Asking so poor love.
5683_32879_000042_000002	I have very few to love me now, and I thought you might love me as I began to love you.
5683_32879_000043_000000	And she threw arms round her cousin's neck, and brave Rachel at last burst into tears.
5683_32879_000046_000002	Thank you from my heart for your love. You will never know perhaps how much it is to me
672_122797_000002_000002	What a nice little furrow, but this was what the tree could not bear to hear.
6829_68769_000005_000004	So this boy was doubly foolish in ruining himself to get $60 to pay an unjust demand.
6829_68769_000006_000000	He was soft-hearted and impetuous, said Beth, and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost.
6829_68769_000012_000001	He was a round-faced, respectable-appearing fellow, but his mood was distinctly unsociable.
6829_68769_000030_000000	Then he deliberately locked Kenneth and Beth in with the forger and retreated along the passage.
6829_68769_000036_000001	He was of sturdy aesthetic build, and dressed neatly, in a suit that was of course material but well brushed and cared for.
6829_68769_000051_000002	D'in Rodgers wouldn't do anything but lead around and wait upon her, and the place went to rack and ruin.
6829_68769_000053_000000	Lucy could have looked after her mother, said young Bates, but old Will, Will, was stubborn and wouldn't let her.
6829_68769_000063_000001	It won't be much, but I'm grateful to find a friend I'm guilty, you know, and there's no one to blame but myself.
6829_68769_000073_000000	I've been bothered already over your election campaign, resumed the manager, arranging his papers in a bored manner.
6829_68769_000073_000002	You may as well understand, sir, that I stand for the Democratic candidate and have no sympathy with your side.
6829_68769_000074_000000	That doesn't interest me especially, sir. Answer doesn't interest me especially. Snowing. I'm not electioneering just now.
6829_68769_000086_000001	I'll pay twice $60 for the delivery to me of the forged check and the withdrawal of the prosecution.
6829_68769_000091_000001	Give me a check for a hundred and fifty and I'll turn over to you. The forged check and quash further proceedings.
6829_68769_000100_000001	and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars.
6829_68771_000010_000007	This trading boats, which was often done, was considered by the politicians quite legitimate.
6829_68771_000010_000008	The only thing necessary was to fix Seth Reynolds and this Hopkins arranged personally.
6829_68771_000012_000001	Every steed known to politicians must be worked, and none knew the intricate game better than Hopkins.
6829_68771_000012_000002	This was why he held several long conferences with his friend Marshall, the manager at the mill.
6829_68771_000012_000003	And this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
6829_68771_000015_000000	Patsy and Beth supported their cousin loyally and assisted in the preparations.
6829_68771_000018_000000	The gardens and grounds were gaily decorated with Chinese and Japanese lantern streamers and forged banners.
6829_68771_000035_000000	For the first time, the maid seemed a little confused, and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
6829_68771_000039_000000	She sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocked slowly back and forth.
6829_68771_000044_000003	Her manner was neither independent nor assertive, but rather one of well-bred composure and calm reliance.
6829_68771_000044_000004	Beth felt that she was intruding and knew that she ought to, ought to go. Yet some fascination held her to the spot.
6829_68771_000044_000006	However, her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness. These hands told a different story.
6829_68771_000046_000001	She rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath.
6930_76324_000005_000001	I thought you were stumped again when I first saw that picture. But it's been of some use after all.
6930_76324_000026_000003	I just touched something soft. On the instant, Joyce was at her side with the candle.
6930_81414_000014_000003	It did not beckon, or indeed move at all. It was as still as the hand of death.
7021_79730_000053_000000	in respect to her statement that she was going to the doctors that may or may not have been true.
7021_79740_000011_000000	then turning to Jane, she asked, in a somewhat altered tone, has she been a good girl? Jane.
7021_79740_000020_000000	There said she, pointing to the playthings, see, all your playthings left out.
7021_79740_000020_000003	They would think that they might do so too, and that would make you a great deal of trouble.
7021_79740_000021_000000	The children went to work with great alacrity and put the playthings all away.
7021_85628_000002_000000	Once upon a time there was a little boy called Anders who had a new cap.
7021_85628_000005_000000	The first person he met was a farm laborer walking alongside a load of peat and smacking at his horse.
7021_85628_000009_000000	Let's swap caps. Let's swap caps, she said, and I will give you my jackknife to boot.
7021_85628_000021_000001	For, like as not, they must have thought him must have fought him. But that's when they saw his fine cap.
7021_85628_000025_000000	Well, well, give it to me," said the Princess, and I will give you a kiss.
7021_85628_000034_000001	He sat as before and held on to his red cap which everybody was so anxious to get.
7021_85628_000035_000001	He darted like an arrow all the stairs and across the yard.
7127_75946_000002_000001	As for the ballet itself, every person knew the part he had to take in it, and how to perform it.
7127_75946_000016_000000	Well, I'm sire, the callow-rooks, the musicians, and the cooks have swallowed up four millions in eight days.
7127_75946_000033_000000	I reserve your services for better occasion, and believe me, they will only be the better appreciated.
7127_75946_000040_000004	The music had boys flutes, and Wiles was delightfully descriptive of rural delights.
7127_75946_000040_000006	He was dressed in a tunic of flowers, which set off his graceful and well-formed figure to advantage.
7127_75946_000041_000001	The applause continued so long that the comp had amped the leisure to join the king.
7127_75946_000045_000000	Sir, your majesty, having given no directions about it, the musicians have retained it.
7127_75946_000058_000000	Every word fell distinctly in perfect harmony and eloquence upon Louis the fourteenth's ears.
7127_75947_000006_000000	The king remained for a moment to enjoy a triumph as it could possibly be.
7127_75947_000006_000009	Degich, observing that she was alone, nearer, a thicket constructed of painted cloth, approached her.
7127_75947_000007_000000	Upon this Madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte, observing
7127_75947_000010_000000	Yes, the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own.
7127_75947_000034_000000	There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly, for in fact you returned without his permission.
7127_75947_000071_000000	Yes, but if she should have understood, do well, she may talk.
7127_75947_000082_000005	The three young girls on their side reached the outskirts of the park, every path of which they well knew.
7176_88083_000002_000004	Moreover, he was not in a situation that the surroundings which one is willing to associate with ducks.
7176_88083_000004_000000	The duck was a handsome male of the red-breasted merganser family, and an absorbing interest of his life was fish.
7176_88083_000004_000002	Here, where the north fork stream fell into the ogensis, was a resort exactly to his liking.
7176_88083_000006_000003	But here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls, hawks, and eagles.
7176_88083_000006_000005	Had he taken such a prize, he could not have profited by it, having no means of tearing it to pieces.
7176_88083_000010_000002	For all its appalling speed, the sound of his flight was nothing more than a strong pulsating hiss.
7176_88083_000011_000005	It was enough, however, and the unhappy teal was hurled earthward, flapping through the tips of the branches.
7176_88083_000012_000000	As it chanced, however, the victim came down with the thud almost beneath the whiskered nose of the wildcat.
7176_88083_000012_000005	The cat growled softly, picked up the prize in her jaws and her jaws, and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
7176_88083_000013_000002	Happily for him, he on his part caught sight of the hawk and dropped like lead into the torrent.
7176_88083_000015_000003	With only head and wings above the mad smother, He flat, onward frantically beating down The foe about him.
7176_88083_000017_000005	Where the waves for an instant sank, they came closer, but not quite within grasping reach.
7176_88083_000017_000006	The marauder from the upper air was waiting till his quarry should reach less turbulent waters.
7176_88083_000018_000000	A few yards further on the torrent fell, seething over a long ledge into a pool of brief quiet.
7176_88083_000018_000003	But wily Drake had plunged with the plunge of the fall itself and was now darting onward at a safe depth of
7176_88083_000022_000000	Just as he made his cast, he saw the fling drake and the pursuing hawk come round the bend.
7176_88083_000023_000004	The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him, and appalling.
7176_88083_000024_000003	He dived and caught it, came to the surface and swallowed it much refreshed. He looked about him.
7176_92135_000004_000002	It was an unsatisfying life, and when rash acquaintances asked him what he did, he used to say that he was for the bar.
7176_92135_000006_000006	Can you give me a few hints? Suppose you spoke to me like this, then I could do something for you.
7176_92135_000012_000003	Of course, a really good actor can often give a clue to the feelings of a character simply by facial expression.
7176_92135_000018_000000	And so on, till you get to the end, When aphelia might say a yes, or something noncommittal of that sort,
7176_92135_000018_000002	One is to make it clear that you are conveying Hamlet's thoughts to the audience in rather a clever manner.
7176_92135_000055_000000	The answer to this will depend upon the length of the play, for upon the length depends the hour at which the curtain rises.
7176_92135_000056_000002	Then the curtain rises and it is apparent that we are assisting in an at home of considerable splendor.
7176_92135_000070_000002	Let your actors have tea by all means, but see that it is a properly histrionic tea.
7729_102255_000010_000014	They were not only well armed and supplied, but wrought up to the highest pitch of partisan excitement.
7729_102255_000012_000001	the people of Lawrence without any great difficulty. Obtain daily information concerning the hostile camps.
7729_102255_000012_000007	With the advantage of its defensive position, Lawrence was as strong as the sheerest mob.
7729_102255_000012_000011	The Missouri Backwoods men manifested an almost incredible interest in this wonderful gun.
7729_102255_000016_000002	The firm defensive attitude of the people of Lawrence had produced its effect.
7729_102255_000016_000003	The leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town.
7729_102255_000016_000006	In the Missouri camp, while the leaders became alarmed, the men grew insubordinate.
7729_102255_000016_000008	The forces of the Lecompton can't fully understand the plot and will fight under the same banner.
7729_102255_000018_000006	Neither party was willing to yield honestly, nor ready to fight manfully.
7729_102255_000021_000000	The truce patched up by this Lawrence Treaty was of comparatively short duration.
7729_102255_000025_000003	The people of Lawrence denounced the deed, but the sheriff hoarded up the score for future revenge.
7729_102255_000028_000004	They're distinctive characters, however, display one broad and unsailing difference.
7729_102255_000028_000008	their assumed character changed with their changes, with their attunities or necessities.
7729_102255_000034_000005	Ten days were consumed in these negotiations, but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield.
7729_102255_000035_000001	He continued his pretended search and, to give color to his errand, made two arrests.
7729_102255_000035_000006	The military force, partly rabble, partly organized. Hadwin Law moved into the town.
7729_102255_000036_000005	The inmates being removed. At the appointed hour a few cannon balls were fired through the stone walls.
8224_274384_000005_000001	He was particularly attentive to the behavior of their preachers, on whom all depended.
8224_274384_000006_000000	Why dost thou, tyrant, boast thyself, thy wicked deeds to praise?
8224_274384_000017_000002	Yet were they little worse, than what were they little worse, Than the one before the battle of Naseby.
8230_279154_000002_000000	Memory, which we are to consider today, introduces us to knowledge in one of its forms.
8230_279154_000004_000006	How, then, are we to find any way of comparing the present image and the past sensation?
8230_279154_000004_000009	This way the whole status of images is copies, as copies is bound up with the analysis of memory.
8230_279154_000007_000000	I am not suggesting that the non-existence of the past should be entertained as a serious hypothesis.
8230_279154_000011_000001	It might be suggested that vagueness is the required characteristic. But I do not think this is the case.
8230_279154_000011_000003	In such a case, we distrust our image in spite of its being unusually clear.
8230_279154_000011_000005	Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar, while others feel strange.
8230_279154_000017_000002	but the rejection of the subject renders some more complicated theory necessary.
8230_279154_000017_000003	Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way related to what is remembered.
8230_279154_000018_000000	Some points may be taken, as such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
8230_279154_000018_000005	Nevertheless, in spite of the risk of error, precision is the goal at which we must aim.
8230_279154_000019_000000	The first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.
8230_279154_000021_000003	These considerations, however, are taking us away from psychology, to which we must now return.
8230_279154_000022_000007	when we at once describe the event. But words we have used easily become habitual.
8230_279154_000024_000000	The sort of memory with which we are here concerned is the sort which is a form of knowledge.
8230_279154_000027_000002	We recognize our friend Jones. We know cats and dogs when we see them. And so on.
8455_210777_000003_000004	And what hope had there been? What hope had there been? What reasonable expectation? That the system should have been allowed fair play.
8455_210777_000012_000002	I must by no means show in such company as was now present the strong feeling which pervaded my own mind.
8455_210777_000014_000000	This was a pretty little speech enough and received the eager compliments of the officers of the John Bright.
8455_210777_000015_000000	Jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to Ava, and was now induced to silence by his praises.
8455_210777_000022_000005	When the President of the Republic has his health drung, it is I conceive his duty to do so.
8455_210777_000034_000000	And that in opposition to the wishes, as I understand, of the large proportion of your fellow citizens,
8455_210777_000040_000000	And you are, I am aware, sufficiently popular with the people here to enable you to do so.
8455_210777_000049_000001	I was to be taken away and carried to England, or elsewhere, or round upon the voyage, it mattered not which.
8455_210777_000050_000001	Now, at the close of the 20th century, could oppression be carried to such a height as this?
8455_210777_000053_000000	Lieutenant Crossdress has sealed orders and is practically acquainted with the mechanism of the gun.
8455_210777_000061_000004	The country has since undoubtedly prospered and in a material point of view has given us no grounds for regret.
8455_210777_000079_000002	All this I could hardly explain to him, as I should thus be giving to him the strongest evidence against my own philosophy.
8463_287645_000003_000002	Nor was he all muscled by a great deal, she all balanced as to mother wit and shrewdness.
8463_287645_000024_000000	When asked what first prompted him to seek his freedom, he replied, Oh my senses.
8463_287645_000030_000001	He hated everything about slavery and as young as he was, he had already made five attempts to escape.
8463_294825_000018_000001	The Poles are quashed with the violence that upheld not only Verne but all Europe.
8463_294825_000030_000000	because, as the time cover suggests, we still haven't caught up with Vern.
8463_294825_000030_000001	Even in our era of satellite dishes and video games, the seas keep their secrets.
8463_294828_000014_000000	Even so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted, and badly needing a rest.
8463_294828_000021_000000	The lad was 30 years old and his age to that of his employer was as 15 as to 20.
8463_294828_000022_000001	He was a fanatic on formality, and he only addressed me in the third point where it got tiresome.
8463_294828_000038_000000	Yes, we are certainly. I reply divasively, that after we make a detour
