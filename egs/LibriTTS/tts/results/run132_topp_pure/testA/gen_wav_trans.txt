1089_134686_000002_000001	After early nightfall, the yellow lamps would light up, here and there, the squalid quarter of the brothels.
1089_134686_000007_000005	The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space.
1089_134686_000009_000003	The chaos in which his ardor extinguished itself was a coal with different knowledge of himself.
1089_134686_000009_000008	What had availed to pray when he knew that his soul lusted after its own destruction?
1089_134686_000015_000003	The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson and went out.
1089_134686_000024_000002	If a layman in the giving baptism pour the water before saying the words as the child baptized,
1089_134686_000026_000003	A gentle kick from the tall boy on the bench behind urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.
1089_134686_000028_000004	Mass will be on Saturday morning at 9 o'clock in the General Communion for the whole college.
1089_134686_000030_000000	A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the rector's grim smile.
1089_134686_000030_000001	Stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.
1089_134686_000032_000006	He is said to have baptized as many as 10,000 idolaters in one month.
1089_134691_000004_000000	Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea as he had ran from her listless silence.
1089_134691_000006_000000	whose feet are as the feet of hearts and underneath the everlasting arms.
1089_134691_000007_000000	The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused.
1089_134691_000013_000004	No, it was not their colors. It was the poison balance of the period itself.
1089_134691_000015_000000	A veiled sunlight lit up faintly, the grey sheet of water where the ridder was embedded.
1089_134691_000025_000002	Perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret thread in their souls.
1089_134691_000027_000000	Their banter was not new to him, and now it flattered his mild, proud sovereignty.
1089_134691_000039_000000	He started up nervously from the stone block, though they could no longer quench the flame in his blood.
1089_134691_000042_000001	Emerald, then black, and rusted and olived, it moved beneath the current, swaying and turning
1089_134691_000042_000002	The water of the rivulet was dark with endless drift, and mirrored the high drifting clouds
1089_134691_000045_000004	Her slate-blue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetail behind her,
1089_134691_000047_000000	Heavenly God, cried Stephen Sowell in an outburst of profane joy,
1089_134691_000049_000002	To live, to live, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life.
1089_134691_000054_000000	Evening had fallen when he woke, and the sanded, arid graces of his bed flowed no longer.
1188_133604_000024_000000	But in this vignette copied from Termer, you have the two principles brought up perfectly.
1188_133604_000028_000003	George of Carpaccio, at Venice, are all that I can name myself of great works.
1188_133604_000048_000001	every plant and the grass is set for me grows perfectly. It made me realize completely
1188_133604_000061_000006	It has no beauty whatsoever, no specialty of picturesqueness, and all its lines are cramped and poor.
121_121726_000005_000001	beggars' pee, the politician's scepter, and the drummer's ape was desistant.
121_121726_000025_000001	Walt had a little butthurt and an injury, now carried by mother Eddie and brother Dowie.
121_127105_000007_000003	If I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce, and that we should only have to wait,
121_127105_000012_000000	He seemed to say it was not so simple as that to be really at a loss how to qualify it.
121_127105_000014_000000	He took no notice of her. He objected me, but as this instead of me he saw what he spoke of.
121_127105_000016_000000	turn round to the fire. Gave a kick to her log, watched it an instant,
121_127105_000018_000001	I took that here. He tapped his heart. I've never lost it.
121_127105_000020_000004	But if you put the inference by without a smile, it was also without irritation.
121_127105_000020_000009	Oh, yes, don't grin, I liked her extremely, And am glad to this day to think she liked me too.
121_127105_000033_000000	story won't tell," said Douglas, not in any literal vulgar way.
121_127105_000044_000003	The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations, and that his own affairs took up all his time.
1284_1180_000007_000000	At the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the MÃ¼nchtens from the country of the Dillikens, the path divided.
1284_1180_000020_000000	I never kneel I was called the unlucky," said old Joe soberly, but it is really a good name for me.
1284_1180_000023_000000	I do not how, but you must keep the matter in mind and perhaps the chance will come to you," she replied.
1284_1180_000027_000000	We are traveling replied Oh Joe, and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves
1284_1180_000045_000002	What is that?" Oto asked, for this seemed even more strange and unusual than a glass cat.
1284_1180_000053_000001	I will show you what a good job I did." And she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors.
1284_1181_000027_000000	This powder must not be used before tomorrow morning, but I think it is now cool enough to be bottled.
1284_1181_000028_000001	Very carefully, he placed the Powder of Life in the bottle and then locked it up in a drawer of his cabinet.
1320_122612_000002_000000	If you find a man there, he shall die of fleas death, merry wives of Windsor.
1320_122612_000006_000004	At last the scouts spoke in English and at once explained the embarrassment of their situation.
1320_122612_000020_000001	A circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn, and each of the party took a segment for his portion.
1320_122612_000021_000000	Such cunning is not without its deviltry!" exclaimed Hakai when he met the disappointed looks of his assistants.
1320_122612_000029_000000	The whole party now proceeded, following the course of the rill, keeping anxious eyes on the regular impressions.
1320_122612_000033_000000	Softly, we know our path, but it is good to examine the formation of things
1320_122612_000037_000001	Seem the heel has hardly touched the ground, and there the Darkir has made a bull jump from root to root.
1320_122612_000037_000002	No, no, my knowledge fort, neither of them was thy fainting hereway.
1320_122612_000051_000001	Do you keep him under your rifle while I creep in behind through the bush and take him alive?
1320_122612_000056_000003	Having reached within the few yards of the ladder, he arose to his feet, silently and slowly.
1320_122617_000043_000001	So, and Cassi would better take the lead, While I will put on the skin again, And trust Cunning for want of speed.
1580_141083_000006_000000	My face temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street.
1580_141083_000006_000001	Without his scrap-books, his chemicals, and his homely untattiness, he was an unconstable man.
1580_141083_000008_000004	I had her extra take tea in a friend's rote, so I left the proof upon my desk.
1580_141083_000009_000002	For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right.
1580_141083_000012_000000	The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third where you left it," said he.
1580_141083_000015_000000	For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers.
1580_141083_000015_000002	The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, had entered to look at the papers.
1580_141083_000016_000006	But again, Hagum Rascal had copy-but-pasted
1580_141083_000017_000000	said Holmes, who was recovering his good of humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.
1580_141083_000018_000004	Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black doer clay which specks at something which looks like sunnest in it.
1580_141083_000047_000007	He carried them over to the window-table, because from there he could see if he came across the courtyard, and so could effect an escape.
1580_141083_000056_000006	I was hoping that if the paper on which she wove was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface.
1580_141083_000061_000001	As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed not three or four suits of clothes hanging from the line of pegs
1580_141083_000063_000000	It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuff, exactly like the one upon the table of the study.
1580_141083_000066_000002	What could he do? He caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into her bedroom to conceal himself.
1580_141083_000070_000000	Blatt of Prahn, Leetfrain Work, Three Separate Windows, One Sringing on Hinge, and Lauderjulove to Admitton Men.
1580_141083_000081_000003	His father was the notorious Serge of Bisneucrst, who ruined himself on the turf.
1580_141084_000009_000001	A tall, flex and haired, slam-young fellow opened it, and made us welcome when he understood our errand.
1580_141084_000009_000007	The outer door would not open to our Norok, and nothing nor substantial in a Torrin-Kabab language came from behind it.
1580_141084_000029_000001	All were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock.
1580_141084_000029_000002	My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation.
1580_141084_000031_000000	Holmes made no further issue to the matter that day, though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner.
1580_141084_000044_000000	The unfortunate Tudor was certainly in a state of pitiful agitation when we found him in his chambers.
1580_141084_000069_000001	He was a fine figure of a man, tall alike, And agile with a springy step and a pleasant open face.
1580_141084_000071_000000	The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look full of horror and reproach at Bannister.
1580_141084_000075_000000	Come, kindly. It is human to err, and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.
1580_141084_000077_000003	I was measuring how tall a man ought to be in order to see, as he passed what papers were on the central table.
1580_141084_000077_000004	I am six feet high, and I'd do it with an effort. No one less than Knopf would have a chance.
1580_141084_000078_000001	Of the set your table. I could make nothing until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long-distance jumper."
1580_141084_000079_000002	As he passed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these proofs upon your table, and then jectured what they were.
1580_141084_000079_000005	It was not a dangerous exploit, for he did all his pretend.
1580_141084_000082_000007	You observe that the Scotch on that table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door.
1995_1826_000016_000011	She wanted a glance at the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms.
1995_1826_000022_000001	Miss Taylor did not know much about cotton, but at least one more remark seemed called for.
1995_1826_000056_000000	She started thinking of cotton, but at once she pulled herself back to the other aspect.
1995_1836_000003_000002	At last the Cotton Combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the Senate.
1995_1836_000019_000000	But, Criswell added significantly, capacity differs enormously between races.
1995_1837_000010_000005	To her, all things meant something, nothing was aimless, nothing merely happened.
1995_1837_000011_000002	Perhaps if the water had but drained from the cotton, it was so strong and tall, but Bixia...
1995_1837_000012_000003	The raindrops were still dripping and gleaming from the trees, flashing back the heavy yellow sunlight.
1995_1837_000019_000001	The cotton-clob was short and poor because of the great rain, but the sun had saved the best and the price had soared.
1995_1837_000021_000002	Besand the swamp, then finding all while, She closed her eyes and slept.
1995_1837_000026_000002	He came down to her, slowly, with fixed, hungry eyes, fretting his way amid the fleece.
2300_131720_000003_000001	It went into service August 15, 1882, about three weeks before the Pearl Street Station.
2300_131720_000004_000006	Wari, if we erect a station at La Falls, it is a great economy to get up to the city.
2300_131720_000004_000012	Burbank and his tribe represented in the fetchful world Edison and the Mechanical.
2300_131720_000006_000001	Every department of mechanics was stimulated and benefited to an extraordinary degree.
2300_131720_000008_000007	I requested him to make a chic brass oil cup and solder it to the base I had.
2300_131720_000008_000009	I then a standard made to hold the mother oil cup so as to see and regulate the drop feed.
2300_131720_000016_000012	They found an engine somewhat loose in the bearings and their followed remarks which would not look well in print.
2300_131720_000019_000001	But this time and long after, our wedding was done on a flat rate basis.
2300_131720_000020_000008	Hence the Edison electrolytic meter is no longer used, despite its excellent qualities.
2300_131720_000023_000003	The meter continued in general service during 1899 and probably up to the close of the century.
2300_131720_000025_000007	A heat from this lamp would prevent the liquid from freezing, so the meter could go on doing its duty.
2300_131720_000026_000000	After the station had been running several months and was technically a success, we began to look after the financial part.
2300_131720_000026_000007	They said they were sorry, that is, Wall Street sorry, and refused to pay it.
2300_131720_000032_000005	The investors in the enterprise were ready and anxious to meet the extra cost of putting the wires underground.
2300_131720_000034_000005	One evening there came a sudden flash of fire, And a spliring, spluttering, sputtering, sizzling
2300_131720_000039_000007	We had two wiring or ground feeders sent without any plans or specifications for their installation.
2300_131720_000040_000005	Among the exhibits of that exposition was the Edison system of incandescent lighting.
2300_131720_000042_000002	The Mishimi was taken up in pieces on the backs of mules from the foot of the mountain.
237_126133_000002_000004	It got to be noticed finally, and one and all had doubled their exhortions to make everything twice as pleasant as ever.
237_126133_000015_000001	Somehow, of all the days when the home-theming was the strongest, this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer.
237_126133_000021_000000	At this the bundle opened suddenly, and out popped Farnsey
237_126133_000024_000000	Are you glad to call?" Polly asked Fawncy, with her little face close to Poe's own.
237_126133_000028_000000	Is her name Farnsey putting Dick unwilling to be left out, and not thinking of anything else to ask?
237_126133_000029_000000	Boys?" whispered their mother, mourningly. She can't answer you. Just look at her face.
237_126133_000034_000000	I know," gasped Polly, consoling her sobs.
237_126133_000043_000000	So you must, cried Jasper, and chanted it is success and amusing and I'll go with you.
237_126133_000046_000000	"'Are you france?' cried Polly, turning around at the last words.
237_134493_000002_000002	Could ye rise from beneath it? He would not know a country under which he has been asleep.
237_134493_000002_000003	The shaky coat of the prairie which they lifted to make him a bed has vanished for ever.
237_134493_000004_000003	The air, and the air that curiously mated and intermingled, as if the one were the breath of the other.
237_134493_000007_000000	Waiting he'd been mulling the better part of an hour. He heard the rattle of a light carc on the road behind him.
237_134493_000007_000001	Supposing that it was his sister coming back from one of her farms, he kept on with his work.
237_134493_000011_000000	Lots of the bohemian boys at the university meal taking up his side again.
237_134493_000013_000001	A first note, nearing your spunky little bunch, you check's he called back over his shoulder.
237_134493_000017_000001	Oh, there's a good boy. She turned her head to him with a quick, bright smile.
237_134493_000021_000001	There were silumae, sheds, and art buildings scooped about it, but the place looked not unlike a tiny village.
237_134493_000021_000002	A stranger approaching it could not help noticing the beauty and fruitfulness of the outlying fields.
237_134493_000021_000003	Or something individual about the glade from a most unusual trim must incur for detail.
237_134493_000022_000001	One room is papered, carpeted, over furnished. The next is almost bare.
237_134500_000001_000002	One of the girls was getting a divorce and Frank took it as a personal effect.
237_134500_000001_000004	Frank read English slowly and the more he brought this divorce case the angrier he grew
237_134500_000003_000004	Frank and Lee Bergson had very similar ideas, and they were two of the political agitators of the company.
237_134500_000014_000002	I'm a good Catholic, but I think I could get along with caring for trees if I hadn't anything else.
237_134500_000015_000000	a poor saying," said Emile, stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass.
237_134500_000016_000002	I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way. They have to learn other things too.
237_134500_000022_000000	O, Emile, you know what I mean." Marie tossed her head. Impatiently, did she really care about him?
237_134500_000023_000000	Who, Alexandra? Emil laughed and thrust his hand into his trousers' pockets.
237_134500_000031_000000	And there are so many, many things I can't do, and Neil echoed her tone sarcastically.
237_134500_000032_000001	I wish she weren't so restless and didn't get so warped up over things, she said sadly.
237_134500_000036_000003	And, anyhow, there's nothing to understand." She struck the ground with her little foot fiercely.
237_134500_000036_000005	It will go away and things will be just as they used to. I wish you were a Catholic.
260_123286_000005_000001	He examines the horizon all round with this glass, and folds his eyes with the air of an injured man.
260_123286_000007_000000	You seem anxious, my uncle," I said, seeing him continually with his glass to his eye.
260_123286_000013_000000	I then remembered that the professor, before starting, had estimated the length of this underground sea at 30 e.
260_123286_000020_000000	I take this as my answer. I leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience.
260_123286_000021_000005	I is possessed in an apprehension lest the electric light should grow dim or fail altogether.
260_123286_000031_000003	They possessed a perfect organization, gigantic proportions, prodigious strength.
260_123286_000033_000003	Yet, the deep marks of conical teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.
260_123286_000034_000003	What a very bad notion it was of his, I thought to myself, to take soundings just here.
260_123286_000038_000001	The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again, at a distance of twenty fathoms.
260_123286_000045_000001	We stood amazed, thunderstruck at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters.
260_123286_000047_000001	The reptiles rose, they wheeled around a little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains.
260_123286_000057_000001	Two monsters only were creating all this commotion and before my eyes are two reptiles in the primitive world.
260_123288_000004_000001	Atmosphere is charged with vapors pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters.
260_123288_000006_000000	In the distance, the clouds resemble great bales of cotton piled up in picturesque disorder.
260_123288_000023_000005	My eyes fail under the daddling light, my ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder.
260_123288_000023_000006	I must be bound to the mast, which bows like a red before the mighty strength of the storm.
260_123288_000040_000000	A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air. It enters the throat that fills the lungs.
260_123288_000045_000004	We have been carried under England, under the Channel, under France, perhaps under the whole of Europe.
260_123440_000010_000002	And yesterday things went on just as usual I wonder, if I've been changed in the night.
260_123440_000018_000002	That would be a queer thing to be sure, however. Everything is queer today.
260_123440_000023_000001	And yet, I wish I could show you our cat Dino. I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
260_123440_000024_000002	Our family always hated cats. Nasty Lola things.
2830_3979_000018_000000	The Reformer had lecture on this epistle of St. Paul's in 1519 and again in 1523.
2830_3979_000018_000002	In his table talks the saying is recorded, Epistle to the Galatians is my epistle.
2830_3979_000018_000006	The lectures which are preserved in the works herewith, submitted to the American public, were delivered in 1531.
2830_3979_000023_000000	Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will to men.
2830_3980_000017_000001	Do you suppose that God, for the sake of a few Lutheran heretics, would disown his entire church?
2830_3980_000018_000000	Against these buzzed and false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry.
2830_3980_000018_000002	He reminds them of the time when he opposed Peter to his face and approved the chief of the apostles.
2830_3980_000021_000000	Every minister should make much of his calling and impress upon others the fact that he has been delegated by God to preach the gospel.
2830_3980_000022_000002	Paul exalts his ministry out of the desire to make known the name, the grace, and the mercy of God.
2961_961_000008_000000	"'Sobretese, excellent to me is, I like your manner of approaching the subject proceed
2961_961_000011_000000	Are there many worlds or one only? That be's the fourth question, one only.
2961_961_000020_000001	And Gok created them according to the patterns or species of them which existed in the divine original.
2961_961_000023_000007	And when external impressions enter and they are really conquered, they'll be seen to conquer.
2961_961_000024_000002	This, however, is an afterstate at present. We are only concerned with the creation of the body and soul.
3570_5694_000007_000005	Enthalmities induced by overindulgence are among some peoples freely recognized as manly attributes.
3570_5694_000007_000009	This invidious traditional distinction has not lost its force even among the more advanced peoples of today.
3570_5694_000010_000001	He is no longer simply the successful, aggressive male, a man of strength, resource and intrepidity.
3570_5694_000011_000004	Costly empty mints such as the pot watch or the bowl are koo-koo-ly adapted to serve this end.
3570_5694_000013_000001	This differentiation is powered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentilitance, of gentility.
3570_5694_000014_000019	In a heightened degree, therefore, delivery comes to be a badge of servitude or rather servitude or rather severity.
3570_5695_000001_000001	It is a fact of common observance that in this lower middle class there is no pretence of leisure on the part of the head of the household.
3570_5695_000001_000003	But the middle-class wife still carries on the business of vicarious leisure for the good name of the household and its master.
3570_5695_000002_000000	The resurrection of the wife in such cases is of course not a simple manifestation of idolatry or indolence.
3570_5695_000004_000003	The observance of these standards in some degree of approximation becomes incumbent upon all classes lower in the scale.
3570_5695_000004_000010	No class of society, not even the most abjectly poor, forgoes all customary conspicuous consumption.
3570_5695_000004_000011	The last items of this category of consumption are not given up except under stress of the dice necessity.
3570_5695_000005_000001	Both our methods are demonstrating a possession of wealth and the TIC are conventionally accepted as equivalents.
3570_5695_000005_000003	On grounds as expediency, the preference may be given to the one or the other at different stages of the economic development.
3570_5695_000005_000004	The question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the person's his convictions that is to the eye to affect.
3570_5695_000008_000002	The result is that in order to keep up a decent appearance, the former habitually lied hand to mouth to a greater extent than the latter.
3570_5695_000008_000005	But that provocation to this line of evidence, as well as its transient effectiveness, is more decided in the city.
3570_5695_000009_000004	Among the latter, everybody's affairs, especially everybody's pecuniary status, are known to everybody else.
3570_5695_000010_000005	At the same time, the wages in the trade are high enough to make movement from place to place relatively easy.
3570_5696_000004_000003	The instinct of workmanship is present in all men and decides itself even under very adverse circumstances.
3570_5696_000007_000004	A reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is accepted by a resort to make-believe.
3575_170457_000010_000007	At first, I could not say, that would be done. I felt menacious, but I knew what was wrong to feel sad.
3575_170457_000015_000003	Whoever, therefore, is ambitious of distinction in this way ought to be prepared for disappointment.
3575_170457_000016_000000	But it is not with a view to distinction. They should cultivate this talent if you consult your own happiness.
3575_170457_000024_000006	My father is a clergyman of Lemedayve at the competent camp, and I am the eldest of his children.
3575_170457_000024_000007	He expended quite as much in my education as he could afford and justice to the rest.
3575_170457_000024_000016	That letter is consecrated. No one shall ever see it but Papa and my brother and sisters.
3575_170457_000031_000002	Let me now request that if you ever should come to these lakes, while I am living here, you will let me see you.
3575_170457_000044_000011	I'm not good enough for you, and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society.
3575_170457_000046_000001	You refused at first to listen to the careful advice. It was repugnant to his liberal nature.
3575_170457_000046_000002	But Miss Banwell persevered, urged economical motives pressed on his love for his daughters.
3729_6852_000008_000001	She held her tongue, but from that time she told everybody that I was an imposter.
3729_6852_000068_000004	Therefore, it is not a paradox to say that the French would be wiser if they were less witty.
4077_13751_000019_000003	But tools were not alternates. Indeed, they never have been for murder and its kindred of grages.
4077_13754_000003_000005	He was unjustly charged with favoring secession, but the charge was soon disproved.
4077_13754_000010_000002	But Mormonism died not. Every added pang of grief served, but to unite the people.
4077_13754_000017_000001	This statement assumes, as granted, a distinction between biomy and the Mormon institution of plural marriage.
4077_13754_000021_000002	And the world is learning, to its manifest surprise, that plural marriage in Mormonism are not synonymous terms.
4077_13754_000023_000004	Its creed provides for the protection of all men in their rites of worship according to the dictates of conscience.
4446_2271_000001_000006	He asked yet we can see Barbie is about everything and his IV about Americans was that they should be engineers and mechanics.
4446_2271_000015_000004	Irene Burgoyne, wife of her family, told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning.
4446_2271_000022_000010	I should torture myself. I couldn't help it after that. It was easy to forget actually to forget.
4446_2271_000023_000011	I shouldn't wonder, but they'd probably spoil her so that she'd be tiresome if one met her
4446_2273_000001_000000	And Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Begwine's invitation and called it her apartment.
4446_2273_000001_000002	Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty, impromptu and cringed servant who answered the door and brought her the tea.
4446_2273_000003_000002	that the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled, and kept crushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure.
4446_2273_000003_000003	Thursday afternoon he cut short at committing me jumped into a handsome and drove to Beckford Square
4446_2273_000014_000001	I can't tell you how glad I am to have you so free and comfortable here and to hear everyone saying such nice things about you.
4446_2273_000015_000003	He's that pithy idiot when he will drink, and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get.
4446_2273_000018_000000	It was a tiny room, a small room, her friend Prince, a bath which ran a shelf full of china.
4446_2273_000035_000000	They were both remembering what the woman had said, and she took them in a... God give you a happy love.
4446_2273_000035_000003	I went home sadly with the lilacs back to the roussant jock walking very slowly arm in arm
4446_2273_000043_000002	Most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly. Sektar amassed her, but he confused me just.
4446_2273_000045_000000	I started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window. It's really too warm in this room to sing.
4446_2273_000048_000001	He stood a little behind her and turned to spreading himself as he said, it's soft and misty.
4446_2275_000001_000001	The staplet pinned down on the tedious passage up the Mercy were things that he noted dimly toward his growing impatience.
4446_2275_000002_000004	A coal fire was crackling in the grave and the lamps withered or poured azole at a beginning to grow dark outside.
4446_2275_000009_000001	She lifted his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapulted leash.
4446_2275_000016_000000	He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room, seeming to find it too small for him.
4446_2275_000018_000000	It has always made you miserable, as if her eyes fell and her lips quivered
4446_2275_000023_000000	Could you sit down and hop about quietly, partly, partly, if I were a friend, and not someone who had to be defied?
4446_2275_000030_000000	Yes, I was happy, wasn't I?" She pressed his hand gently in gratitude.
4446_2275_000033_000000	Yes, she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him presently, and stole back to his coat sleeve.
4446_2275_000038_000006	You want to tell me that you can only see me like this as old friends do her out in the world among people?
4446_2275_000040_000004	What I mean is that I want you to pass as much of the scene as you can, no matter how often I come, no matter how high I get.
4446_2275_000046_000006	That I met you later, that I had loved you so well, but that's all over long ago.
4446_2275_000047_000001	Burtly bent over and kicked her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.
4507_16021_000022_000000	Now one has horror of her excluded study.

4507_16021_000031_000001	Barrett clothes itself in word masks and metaphor rags.
4507_16021_000034_000001	It gnashes and whispers, completing gloom mystery.

4507_16021_000036_000007	Do I saw every one day out of 100?
4507_16021_000036_000009	As for the rest of mankind, stagnating night rests upon them.
4507_16021_000037_000001	In this world evidently the vessel of another, there are no fortunate
4507_16021_000039_000000	However, he who says light does not necessarily say joy.

4970_29093_000028_000000	It was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was one morning walking down Broadway with Henry Briarley
4970_29093_000029_000000	The two were intimate at that time. They had been classmates and saw a great deal of each other.
4970_29093_000044_000000	The night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Phaib would not take such an important step without informing his friends
4970_29093_000044_000002	Happy youth that is ready to pack its valhalls and start for Cathay on an hour's notice.
4970_29093_000049_000001	He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.
4970_29093_000050_000006	If he was unsuccessful, or if he never returned, perhaps it would be as well.
4970_29095_000003_000006	Whatever she thought, she was not idly musing, as one might see by the expression of her face.
4970_29095_000009_000000	If I'm a safe mother, I want to go away and get out of this dead level.
4970_29095_000015_000000	Ruth turned square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and not the slightest change of tone, said,

4970_29095_000049_000000	I want to be something, to make myself something, to do something.
4970_29095_000049_000002	What wonderful thing could I do for a living or the support of mother and children.
4970_29095_000051_000000	Somewhat, that depends upon whether her children amount to anything," retorted the shark, little dishevelled.
4970_29095_000054_000000	Ruth did not reply directly. She complained that her mother didn't understand her.
4970_29095_000054_000001	But that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than Ruth understood herself.
4992_23283_000033_000000	My lord, Miss Milner's taste is not a depraved one. It is but too refined.
4992_23283_000043_000001	To relieve her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said, Do you believe me?
4992_41797_000015_000002	Always irritable, cold, and different. He had grown rapidly more so as years went on.
4992_41797_000025_000005	She's older than I am, but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child.
4992_41797_000026_000000	Have you ever looked at a stone and seen the pale yellow, stented
4992_41806_000009_000000	Note, no, most everything she says sounds like the Bible or Shakespeare to me.
4992_41806_000010_000001	Then Nancy handed Peter a loosely bound sheath, saying, To light this fire I give you a torch
4992_41806_000020_000001	The Hesedesis Solitarian Annalise, bless the life that is sheltered here.
4992_41806_000025_000001	Approaching the dining table, he carefully placed the art decor in the center and removed the cloth.

5105_28241_000019_000004	The Dangers, like all the other coast towns, had apparently been absorbed into the bowels of the earth.
5105_28241_000021_000000	Is it not impossible, he murmured aloud, that any city should disappear so completely?
5105_28241_000024_000000	You must see, Lieutenant, I should think, that we are not so near the coast of Algeria as you imagined.
5142_33396_000008_000000	This is my vow I will sail to Norway, and I will harry the coasts and fill my boat with riches.
5142_33396_000010_000000	But others jumped to their feet with their meek horns in their hands, thirty men one after another, raised their horns, and said,
5142_33396_000039_000001	They set up a crane over the fire and hung a pot upon it and we sat and watched it boil while we joked.
5142_33396_000053_000000	Well, after we had been there for a wonton, Haka came into the feast one night and said,
5142_36377_000008_000005	A little crack that in the popular phrase was my impression of a stranger, who now made his appearance in the supper-room.
5142_36377_000010_000006	They pointedly drew back from Don Iago as he approached the empty chair next to me, and moved round to the opposite side of the table.
5142_36377_000014_000003	She changed color for a moment and looked at him with a pretty, reluctant tenderness as she took her chair.

5142_36586_000011_000002	When one kidney ceases to act from disease, the other increases in size.
5142_36600_000007_000007	The races differ also in constitution and aglomeration and in liability to certain diseases.
5639_40744_000003_000001	Rodolfo was now impatient to get rid of Licoria, and made up his mind to lay her on the street, insensible as she was.
5639_40744_000026_000006	If my wife brings me this, I will thank Heaven for the gift, and make my parents happy in their old age.
5639_40744_000027_000002	Rodolfo thanked her, and supper being ready, they went to join the rest of the party at table.
5683_32865_000006_000000	The churchyard meteor expire. There was nothing in a moment but his brand new smile of recognition
5683_32865_000016_000002	It is such a darling little thing, and looked now is not magnificent.
5683_32865_000021_000001	I see to be sure really Wilder. It is your taste, infinite credit.
5683_32865_000022_000000	I'm glad you like it," says Wilder, chuckling benignly on it over his shoulder.
5683_32865_000028_000000	Warbur was laughing rather ruddily. The dot bore part of his face very solely, I thought.
5683_32865_000030_000000	Whereupon Lake laughed quietly, still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.

5683_32866_000016_000002	She was so unreserved, it seemed, and yet in this directness there was something almost contemptuous.
5683_32866_000028_000000	It is very happy for her at least they are not said Rachel in a long silence ensued
5683_32866_000039_000005	Whatever you monetate, he probably anticipates it. You know best, and you will find him prepared.
5683_32866_000039_000007	You were always the same, close, dark and crooked, and wise in your own conceit.
5683_32866_000047_000008	The sun in your old tree is like gigantic, cursed plumes, black and awful.
5683_32879_000014_000002	You have been loyal than I thought, darling, and you are still far from quite recovered.
5683_32879_000015_000000	Rachel's caling sharpened features, and dilated, I struck her with a painful surprise.
5683_32879_000016_000000	I shall soon be as well as I ever likely to be that is quite well into Rachel
5683_32879_000029_000001	I meant to speak to him and end all between us, and I would now write that there is no address to his letters."
5683_32879_000040_000000	Dorkies, you are changed. Have I lost your love for asking so poor a kindness?
5683_32879_000042_000002	I have very few to love me now and I thought you might love me as I have begun to love you.
5683_32879_000043_000000	And she threw her arms round her cousin's neck and brave Rachel at last burst into tears.
5683_32879_000046_000002	Thank you from my heart for your love. You will never know, perhaps, how much it is to me.
672_122797_000002_000002	What a nice little fur! But this was what the tree could not bear to hear.
6829_68769_000005_000004	So this boy was doubly foolish in ruining himself to get $60 to pay an unjust demand.
6829_68769_000006_000000	He was self-hearted and impetuous," said Bess, and being in love, he didn't step to count the bust.
6829_68769_000012_000001	He was a round feast, respectable repair-o-fellow, but his mood was distinctly unsociable.
6829_68769_000030_000000	Then he deliberately locked Kenneth and Beth in with the forger, and retreated below the passage.
6829_68769_000036_000001	The view was a sturdy, athletic build and dressed neatly in a suit that was of course material but well brushed and cared for.
6829_68769_000051_000002	Then Rogers wouldn't do anything but leer around and wait upon her, and the place lent to Rackham ruined.
6829_68769_000053_000000	Usi could have looked after her mother, said young Bits, but old Rue was stubborn and wouldn't let her.
6829_68769_000063_000001	It won't be much, but I'm grateful to find a friend I... a friend I'm guilty, you know, and there's no one to blame but myself.
6829_68769_000073_000000	I've been bothered already over your OFFGene campaign. Resume the manager. Arrange your newspapers in a board manner.
6829_68769_000073_000002	You may as well understand, sir, that I stand for the democratic candidate and have no sympathy with your side.
6829_68769_000074_000000	That doesn't interest me especially, sir," answered Kenneth, smiling.
6829_68769_000086_000001	I'll pay twice $60 for the delivery to me of the forged check and the withdrawal of the prosecution.
6829_68769_000091_000001	Give me a check for 150 and I'll turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings.
6829_68769_000100_000001	and to think we can save all that misery and despair at the payment of $150.
6829_68771_000010_000007	The straying of votes, which was often done, was considered by the politicians quite legitimate.
6829_68771_000010_000008	The only thing necessary was to fix Seth Reynolds and the Hopkins arranged personally
6829_68771_000012_000001	Every scheme known to politicians must be worked, and men knew the intricate game better than Hopkins.
6829_68771_000012_000002	This was why he held several long conferences with his friend Marshall, the manager of the mill.
6829_68771_000012_000003	And this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered in a conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
6829_68771_000015_000000	Patsy and Beth supported their KsÃ©zen loyally and assisted in the preparations.
6829_68771_000018_000000	The gardens and grounds were dutifully decorated with Chinese and Japanese lanterns, streamers, and Forbes banners.
6829_68771_000035_000000	But for the first time, the maid seemed a little confused, and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
6829_68771_000039_000000	She sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap, roped slowly back and forth.
6829_68771_000044_000003	Her manner is neither independent nor assertive, but rather one of well-bred composure and calm reliance.
6829_68771_000044_000004	Beth felt that she was intruding and knew that she ought to go, yet some fascination held her to the spot.
6829_68771_000044_000006	However her features and form might repress any evidence of marvelousness, these lands told a different story.
6829_68771_000046_000001	She rose quickly to her feet, with an impetuous desire that made her visitor catch her breath.
6930_76324_000005_000001	I thought we were stumped again when I first saw that picture, but it's been of some use after all.
6930_76324_000026_000003	I just touched something soft. Then the instant choice was at her side with the candle.
6930_81414_000014_000003	It did not beckon, or indeed move at all. It was as still as the hand of death.
7021_79730_000053_000000	In respect to her statement that she was going to the doctors, it may or may not have been true.
7021_79740_000011_000000	Then, turning to Jane, she asked, in a somewhat altered tone,â "'Cause she been a good girl, Jane?"
7021_79740_000020_000000	"'Dare!' said she, pointing to the playthings. "'See! All your playthings left out.
7021_79740_000020_000003	They would think that they might do so too, and that would make you a great deal of trouble.
7021_79740_000021_000000	So the children went to work with great alacrity and put the playthings all away.
7021_85628_000002_000000	Once upon a time, there was a little boy, called I-Nurse, who had a new cap.
7021_85628_000005_000000	The first person he met was a farm labourer walking alongside a load of peat and snacking in his horse.
7021_85628_000009_000000	Let's swap cats, he say, and I will give you my jack-knife to boot.
7021_85628_000021_000001	For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
7021_85628_000025_000000	Well, well really to me, said the Princess, and I will give you a kiss.
7021_85628_000034_000001	He sat as before and held on to his red cap, which everybody was so anxious to get.
7021_85628_000035_000001	He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
7127_75946_000002_000001	As for the ballet itself, every person knew the part, he had to take in it, and how to perform it.
7127_75946_000016_000000	world's sire, the colored lamps, the fireworks, the musicians and the cooks have swallowed up four millions in eight days.
7127_75946_000033_000000	I reserve your services for a better occasion and believe me they will only be the better appreciated.
7127_75946_000040_000004	The music, hotboys, flutes and viols, was delightfully descriptive of rural delights.
7127_75946_000040_000006	He was dressed in a tunic of flower, which set off his graceful and law-formed figure to advantage.
7127_75946_000041_000001	The applause continued so long that the comp had ample leisure to join the king.
7127_75946_000045_000000	Far from it, sire, your majesty having given no directions about it, the musicians have retained it.
7127_75946_000058_000000	Every word fell distinctly in perfect harmony and eloquence upon Lulith the Fourteenth's ears.
7127_75947_000006_000000	The king remained for a moment to enjoy a triumph as complete as it could possibly be.
7127_75947_000006_000009	The gitch, observing that she was alone, near a thicket constructed of painted cloth, approached her.
7127_75947_000007_000000	Upon the spadane deemed to turn her eyes, languishingly towards Ducomte, observe it.
7127_75947_000010_000000	Yes, the character, which your royal highness
7127_75947_000034_000000	There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly, for, in fact, you would turn without his permission.
7127_75947_000071_000000	Yes, but if she should have understood, and understood too well, she may talk
7127_75947_000082_000005	The three young girls on their side reached the outskirts of the park, every path of which they well knew.
7176_88083_000002_000004	Moreover, he was not in the situation of the surroundings which one is wont to associate with debts.
7176_88083_000004_000000	The duck calls a handsome male of the red-breasted, Morgantzer family, and he absorbing interest in his life with fish.
7176_88083_000004_000002	Here, where the noise fork-stream fell into the autumn mists, was a resort exactly to his liking.
7176_88083_000006_000003	But here he was at terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls, hawks and eagles.
7176_88083_000006_000005	Honeycake in such a prize. He could not have pieced it by having no means of tearing it to pieces.
7176_88083_000010_000002	Though all its appalling speed, the sound of this flight was nothing more than a strong pulsating hiss.
7176_88083_000011_000005	It was enough, however, and the unhappy teal was hurled earthward, flapping through the toots of the branches.
7176_88083_000012_000000	As a chance, however, the victim came down with a thud almost beneath the whiskered nose of the wildcat.
7176_88083_000012_000005	The cat growled softly, picked up the prize in her jaws, and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
7176_88083_000013_000002	Happily for him, he owned his part caught sight of the hawk and dropped like lead into the torrent.
7176_88083_000015_000003	With only head and wings above the mad smother, He flat onward, frantically beating down the foam about him.
7176_88083_000017_000005	Where the waves for an instant sank, they came closer, but not quite within grasping reach.
7176_88083_000017_000006	The marauder from the upper air was waiting till his quarry should reach Los Turbulent Waters.
7176_88083_000018_000000	A few yards further on, the Tewarn fell seething over a long ledge into a pool of brief quiet.
7176_88083_000018_000003	The wily drake had plunged with the plunge with the plunge of the fall itself and was now darting onward at a safe depth.
7176_88083_000022_000000	Just as he made his cast, he saw the fleeing drake and the pursuing hawk come round the bend.
7176_88083_000023_000004	The drag upon his beak and the light chink upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling.
7176_88083_000024_000003	He dived in Kite, came to the surface and swallowed it much refreshed, he looked about him.
7176_92135_000004_000002	It was an unsatisfying life and when rash acquaintances asked him what he did he used to say that he was full of bar
7176_92135_000006_000006	Can you give me a few of yints? Suppose you spoke to me like this. Then I could do something for you.
7176_92135_000012_000003	Of course, a really good actor can often give a clue to the feelings of a character simply by facial expression.
7176_92135_000018_000000	And so on, till you get to the end, when Ophelian might say, Ah, yes, or something not conical in that sort.
7176_92135_000018_000002	What you want is to make it clear that you are conveying Hamlet the thoughts to the audience in rather a clever manner.
7176_92135_000055_000000	The answer to this will depend upon the length of the play, for upon the length depends the hour at which the curtain rises.
7176_92135_000056_000002	Then the curtain rises, and it is apparent that they are assisting an ended home of considerable splendor.
7176_92135_000070_000002	The two actors have tea by all means, but see that it is a properly histrionic tea.
7729_102255_000010_000014	They were not only well armed and supplied, but rocked to the highest pitch of partisan excitement.
7729_102255_000012_000001	The people of Lawrence, without any great difficulty, obtained daily information concerning the hostile camps.
7729_102255_000012_000007	With the advantage of its defensive position, Warrants was as strong as the sheriff's mob.
7729_102255_000012_000011	The Missouri Backwoods men manifested an almost incredible interest in this wonderful gun.
7729_102255_000016_000002	The firm, defensive attitude of the people of Lawrence had produced its effect.
7729_102255_000016_000003	The leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town.
7729_102255_000016_000006	Then the Missouri came, while the leaders became alarmed and grew insubordinate.
7729_102255_000016_000008	The forces of the Lickington camp fully understand the plot and will fight under the same banner.
7729_102255_000018_000006	Neither party was willing to yield honestly, nor ready to fight manfully.
7729_102255_000021_000000	The truce patched up by this warren's treaty was of comparatively short duration.
7729_102255_000025_000003	That people of Lawrence denounced the deed, but the sheriff hurried up the score for future revenge.
7729_102255_000028_000004	Their distinctive characters, however, display one broad and unfailing difference.
7729_102255_000028_000008	There are soon character change with their changing opportunities or necessities.
7729_102255_000034_000005	Ten days were consumed in these negotiations, but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield.
7729_102255_000035_000001	He continued his pretended search, and to give color to his errand, made two arrests.
7729_102255_000035_000006	The military force, partly rabble, partly organized, had meanwhile moved into the town.
7729_102255_000036_000005	The inmates being removed, at the appointed hour, a few cannonballs were fired through the stone walls.
8224_274384_000005_000001	He was particularly attentive to the behavior of their preachers, whom he had learned to depend on.
8224_274384_000006_000000	Why dost thou, tyrant, boast thyself By witted deeds to praise?
8224_274384_000017_000002	Yet were they little worse than what were insisted on before the battle of Naseby.
8230_279154_000002_000000	Memory, which we are to consider today, introduces us to knowledge in one of its forms.
8230_279154_000004_000006	How then are we to find any way of comparing the present image and the past sensation?
8230_279154_000004_000009	In this way, the whole status of images as copies is bound up with the analysis of memory.
8230_279154_000007_000000	I'm not suggesting that the non-existence of the past should be entertained as a serious hypothesis.
8230_279154_000011_000001	It might be suggested that vagueness is the required characteristic, but I do not think this is the case.
8230_279154_000011_000003	In such a case, we distrust our image in spite of its being unusually clear.
8230_279154_000011_000005	Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar while others feel strange.
8230_279154_000017_000002	But the rejection of the subject renders some more complicated theory necessary.
8230_279154_000017_000003	A memory has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered.
8230_279154_000018_000000	Some points may be taken as fixed, and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
8230_279154_000018_000005	Nevertheless, in spite of the risk of error, precision is the goal at which we must aim.
8230_279154_000019_000000	The first of our great but indubitable data is that there was knowledge of the past.
8230_279154_000021_000003	These considerations, however, are taking us away from psychology to which we must now return.
8230_279154_000022_000007	When we once describe the event, the words we have used easily become habitual.
8230_279154_000024_000000	The sort of memory with which we are here concerned is the sort which is a foreign of knowledge.
8230_279154_000027_000002	We recognize our friend Jones, we know cats and dogs when we see them, and so on.
8455_210777_000003_000004	and what hope had there been what reasonable expectation that the system should have been allowed fair play.
8455_210777_000012_000002	I must by no means show in such company as was now present the strong feeling which pervaded my own mind.
8455_210777_000014_000000	This was a pretty little speech enough and received the eager compliments of the officers of the John Bright
8455_210777_000015_000000	Jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to Ava and was now reduced to silence by her praises.
8455_210777_000022_000005	When the President of the Republic has his health drunk, it is I conceive his duty to do so.
8455_210777_000034_000000	and that in opposition to their wishes, as I understand it, a large proportion of their fellow citizens.
8455_210777_000040_000000	And you are, I am aware, sufficiently popular with the people here to enable you to do so.
8455_210777_000049_000001	Those to be taken away and carried to England or elsewhere or drowned upon a voyage, it matter not which.
8455_210777_000050_000001	Now, at the close of the 20th century, could oppression be carried to such a height as this?
8455_210777_000053_000000	Lt. Crostris has sealed orders and is practically acquainted with the mechanism of the gun.
8455_210777_000061_000004	The country has since undoubtedly prospered, and in a mature point of view has given us no grounds for regret.
8455_210777_000079_000002	All this I could hardly explain to him as I should thus be giving to him, as I should thus be giving to him, the strongest evidence against my own philosophy.
8463_287645_000003_000002	nor was he all muscle by a great deal. He was well balanced as to mother wit and shrewdness.
8463_287645_000024_000000	When asked what first prompted him to seek his freedom, he replied, Ã¬Oy, senses.Ã®
8463_287645_000030_000001	He hated everything like slavery, and as young as he was, he had already made five attempts to escape.
8463_294825_000018_000001	The tools were quashed with a violence that appalled not only Verne but all Europe.
8463_294825_000030_000000	because, as that Timetover story suggests, we still haven't caught up with Vern.
8463_294825_000030_000001	even our air of satellite dishes and video games, the seeds keep their secrets.
8463_294828_000014_000000	Even so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and badly needing a rest.
8463_294828_000021_000000	The lad was thirty years old, and his age to that of his employer was as fifteen is to twenty.
8463_294828_000022_000001	He was a fanatic on formality, and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it got tiresome.
8463_294828_000038_000000	Yes, we are, certainly," and replied divisively, that after we'd make it to tour,
8463_294828_000047_000001	I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France.
8463_294828_000067_000000	and can until it reaches the waters of the Hudson River at the tip of the Long Peninsula that forms New York City.
8555_284447_000008_000000	So how were the monarchies like to defy me? Both trod you could defy me? As clod did you.
8555_284447_000010_000001	My God, so not to be trusted and I didn't mean to let you out of my sight again until you were patched.
8555_284447_000012_000001	No one could see her, so no one, not even Captain Bill, knew she was there.
8555_284447_000013_000001	Invisible, Frat followed stubbornly and after them still wondering what she could do to save her friend.
8555_284447_000018_000000	The throne of the great knife is high and big, and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon.
8555_284447_000018_000003	Therefore Her Majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her.
8555_284447_000020_000002	These plumes of waves glistening in the air with every mincing step, the princesses talk
8555_284447_000033_000003	Oh, and capture the first living creature you see, and bring him here to be patched to Captain Bill.
8555_284447_000036_000000	Suddenly, there was a noise in the corridor and evidence of scuffling and struggling.
8555_284447_000047_000000	The soldiers again ruled the Phalen position, having first pulled the weight knife once more to the top of the derrick.
8555_284447_000048_000000	When all was in readiness the king pulled the cord as
8555_284447_000064_000000	It's a de easy, quizzy. Cack yourself!" said Cat and Bill.
8555_284447_000066_000000	Then they rolled the frame in position underneath the great knife and trot held in her hand, the cord which would release it.
8555_284449_000007_000000	In this order they proceeded to the main gate, which Trot ordered the guards to throw wide open.
